"149","Topic_1",0.507109004739337,"As a typical sustainable product-service system, the aero-engine overhaul service aims to recover the functionality to fulfil certain flight hours and thrust requirements. How to configure the overhaul service with various sub-services is a key issue in industry. In this paper, a use-oriented aero-engine overhaul service configuration approach is proposed with two methods: overhaul service configuration and part repair service configuration. The overhaul service configuration method decomposes the overhaul service into various sub-services and creates a hierarchical service tree model, taking the cost and energy consumption into consideration. Based on the sub-service filtering and selection rule, the bill of exchange service comes with the bill of discard service. The part repair service configuration method matches each part repair procedure service with a proper service provider. Some non-dominated bills of repair services are obtained by minimizing the repair service cost, finishing time deviation and energy consumption. Considering the multi-objective character of the overhaul service configuration problem, these two methods result in some Pareto solutions to fulfil the service requirements. Through implementing the approach as a prototype, a case study is shown to illustrate the use-oriented aero-engine overhaul service configuration approach and verify its feasibility. A bridge between the flight hours and thrust requirements and the overhaul service configuration results is built when the cost and energy consumption are minimized. The study contributes to the shift of aero-engine overhaul services from the add-on services to sustainable use-oriented product-service systems.","Huibin Sun, Yang Liu, Tomohiko Sakao, Zhan Wang, Configuring use-oriented aero-engine overhaul service with multi-objective optimization for environmental sustainability, Journal of Cleaner Production, Available online 7 December 2016, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.12.022.

The combination of both architectures has been recognized as an attractive solution for the conception of more flexible and reactive systems. Services, originally conceived for web applications, need new models that better adapt to the needs of manufacturing systems namely, the specification and planning of processes. This paper proposes a methodology for designing customizable product-process specifications based on manufacturing-services that are suitable for product driven applications. A framework is proposed for modeling manufacturing-services designed for its application in Holonic Manufacturing Systems, preserving the fractal character found in products and processes. Three types of manufacturing processes are identified based on the relations among its composing operations and a model is proposed for each type. Application service-ontologies are created to describe operations and resource capabilities rather than complex semantic descriptions to facilitate process design and reduce the computational load of service discovery for planning. The framework leverages service reusability among process families in the same way as physical features are reused among product families. An illustrative example describes the design of a product's process specification based on the manufacturing service framework in a Holonic Manufacturing System, giving rise to Service-oriented Holonic Manufacturing Systems.","Francisco Gamboa Quintanilla, Olivier Cardin, Anne L?™Anton, Pierre Castagna, A modeling framework for manufacturing services in Service-oriented Holonic Manufacturing Systems, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, Volume 55, October 2016, Pages 26-36, ISSN 0952-1976, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.engappai.2016.06.004.

"514","Topic_1",0.468354430379747,"Most of manufacturing enterprises design their products through the 3D CAD system. Generated 3D CAD data are mainly used in design and manufacturing stage for product engineering. Since the 3D CAD data includes not only shape models but also part structures and specifications, it is possible to reuse the data in various kinds of manufacturing-related activities after design and manufacturing. For example, 3D CAD data could be used to produce a catalog for marketing and promotion of products by replacing product images, a manual provided to the customers by implementing the animation for the operation of the product and educational materials for training of service staffs by guiding maintenance instructions interactively. These activities for customer support are necessary and significant from the perspective of product lifecycle although they may be not directly related to productivity and quality of products. However, a lot of manufacturing enterprises, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized Enterprises) have difficulty in to carry out these activities due to problems of cost and labor. In this context, this study proposes a new service model to support the manufacturing-related activities to be able to use 3D CAD data. The service model could operate through a software system as follows: A service provider (e.g. IT service vendor) makes core functions to process and manipulate 3D model a form of service platform and develops applications based on the service platform according to the supporting activities so that more applications could be added and expanded effectively. A service consumer (e.g. manufacturing enterprise) requests a service with required data such as 3D CAD data and service contents data to the provider and receives deliverables corresponding to the service. To implement the service model, this study specifies stakeholders, workflow and data of the service model, and develops the service platform. And this study illustrates an industrial case of the service model by developing a 3D digital catalog application and demonstrating a home appliance example.","Joo-Sung Yoon, Hyeok-Jin Kwon, Bo-Hyun Kim, Ju-Yeon Lee, Development of a Service Platform for Servitization of Manufacturing-related Activities to Use 3D CAD Data, Procedia CIRP, Volume 30, 2015, Pages 90-95, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2015.02.108.

For the efficient cleaning, it requires the lights switch on in the cleaning room. For this purposes the vacuum cleaner has to interact with the adaptive illumination control system.Manipulating robot move light furniture (e.g. chairs, or coffee table) or decorative elements (pots with flowers, vases, etc.). It interacts with the vacuum cleaner for synchronization of moving light furniture.For the strategic level, a special strategic planning service has been identified that determines general strategy of resources behavior in the scenario based on interaction with personal mobile device and current situation in smart home. Example of general strategies can be for example reduction in energy consumption, excellent cleaning. For the planning level, a special room management services have been proposed that provide general behavior the cyber-physical-social systems resources in physical level.

However, the massive diversity of personalized products and services offered leads to the internal diversification of products and services, which greatly increases production costs. The application of the modular method can effectively improve the reusability of a product or service, and reduce internal diversification of the product and service. In this paper, the interactive modular design process is established by the analysis of the relationship between a product or service of integrated service product (ISP) and the analysis of the physical module and service module. This paper deals with the module partition principle of ISP, puts forward the three-stages module partition processes and methods, mainly including service module partition processes based on the ?œTop-Down??and ?œBottom-Up??methods, the physical module partition process based on the ?œTop-Down?? and the module partition methods based on Quality Function Deployment and mapping matrix.

The ability to accurately predict the costs of supporting functional product contracts is crucial to the provider in correctly pricing those contracts and for the development and implementation of an efficient service support system. Since the costs incurred are performance based and accumulated over a long duration, they are difficult to predict without effective modelling and decision support tools. This paper discusses a decision support tool that has been developed to provide detailed analysis of the predicted long-term costs of supporting functional product contracts. The tool features a web based user interface to allow collaborative use of the tool by multiple users. The cost predictions are obtained through a discrete event simulation model that emulates the performance of the hardware and service support system used by the provider to fulfil the functional requirements specified in the contracts. The simulations are executed on automatically provisioned remote web based servers, meaning that the computing resources utilised are not limited by the user?™s client device.

Because of the low cost of designing, developing and maintaining DCM-PSS due to its simple, open and scalable architecture, it can not only satisfy the requirement of developing dynamic cellular manufacturing system for Small and Medium Enterprise (SMEs), but also provide high-value-added services for DCMS manufacturers.","Bin Wu, Sixia Fan, Andrew Junfang Yu, Lifeng Xi, Configuration and operation architecture for dynamic cellular manufacturing product?“service system, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 131, 10 September 2016, Pages 716-727, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.04.107.

Functional Products is one such business model, where the provider offers a function to customers at an agreed-upon level of availability, productivity or efficiency, etc. A Functional Product comprises the following four main constituents: hardware, software, service support system and management of operation, which together deliver value to customers on a long-term basis. This paper, based on empirical data, provides an outline and starts the verification of a proposed overall Functional Product lifecycle combining and coordinating its economic- and technical perspectives. The perspectives are combined and the key aspects of the necessary coordination between and within the perspectives, i.e., sustainable win-win situations and coordination of sub-lifecycles for the economic perspective, and the need for coordination between the Functional Products??technical perspective's four sub-lifecycles (hardware, software, service-support system and management of operation), are elaborated and discussed. Further, addition of new functionality, contract management, and long-term management of operation are discussed in the light of managing fleets/individual customers, assets and availability.

Offers are proposed but not generalized as manufacturers encounter obstacles. The main one comes from the separation that exists between products and services which lead to define specific management tools and methods. Today, the economical context leads manufacturing firms to consider priorities managed by service providers and external elements coming from the customers. Moreover, manufacturers are obliged to consider products and services deliveries as a mixed activity. To respond to these problematics, we propose to use enterprise modeling methods to define the bases of a reference model of a mixed enterprise able to propose products and product services paying attention to specific management functions to ensure customer satisfaction.","T.

The ionospheric induced-error, which is the largest and most variable error source of GNSS applications, is proportional to TEC along the satellite-receiver path. Simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from six African equatorial and low latitude stations in the southern hemisphere are used to investigate the latitudinal variation of TEC over the region during the year 2013, a year of moderate solar activity. The analysis reveals some detailed features of seasonal, month-to-month and solar activity dependence of TEC. The seasonal variation of TEC revealed that the daytime and the pre-midnight values of TEC for stations located close to the geographic equator is considerably higher in equinoxes and June solstice compared to stations farther from the equator, however, the difference is insignificant during the December solstice. The month-to-month variation of TEC shows semi-annual symmetry/asymmetry in TEC values for stations closer/farther from the equator. TEC sensitivity to solar activity shows significant seasonal and latitudinal characteristics. Generally, a relatively good correlation exists between TEC and F10.7 for stations around the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region compared to those found at stations close to the equator. Beyond the EIA region, the correlation coefficients drop in all seasons. TEC predicted by the three topside options of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2012 model [i.e. the NeQuick (NeQ), IRI-2001 Corrected (IRI-01 Corr) and the IRI-2001 (IRI-01) options] exhibits latitudinal and seasonal characteristics. The NeQ option performed better than the other two options at stations located within the equatorial region in most of the months and seasons. Outside the EIA region, the IRI-01 Corr and IRI-01 options give better predictions. Generally, the three model options give improved TEC representations with increasing latitude.","S.J. Adebiyi, I.A.

The installations are considered as assemblies that are made up of a number of repairable components. A component repair center and an assembly facility are both modeled as product form queuing networks. Failures of the assemblies occur according to a Poisson process. There are stock points for both ready-for-use assemblies and components. The inventory control policy employed at each stock point is a base-stock policy. Upon failure of an assembly, it is replaced by a ready-for-use one, if available. The failed assembly is inspected to identify and disassemble the broken component causing its failure. Next, the broken component is sent to the component repair center and one ready-for-use component is requested from the stock of this component. Once a ready-for-use component is available for the assembly, the request and the available component are merged and sent to the assembly facility. Completion of a component repair or an assembly operation results in a replenishment of the corresponding stock point. Requests that cannot be satisfied right away are backordered. Service discipline is first-come-first-serve at each facility. Assuming that only one component is identified at a time as the cause of an assembly failure, first an alternative slightly aggregated (but exact) formulation is given for the system and then a near-product-form solution is proposed as an approximate steady-state distribution of the aggregated system. Comparison of the approximate performance measures computed with the use of the near-product-form solution and the ones obtained with simulation shows that the approximation is quite accurate. Relying on the accuracy, approximate performance measures are used for optimizing base-stock levels with a greedy procedure.","W.Henk Zijm, Zeynep MÃ¼ge AvÅŸar, Capacitated two-indenture models for repairable item systems, International Journal of Production Economics, Volumes 81??2, 11 January 2003, Pages 573-588, ISSN 0925-5273, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0925-5273(02)00360-2.

We define feature bands and land use/cover types as the feature and class variables, respectively, and describe them as nodes in the DAG. BNC only uses the posterior probability of the class node, and predicts the class with the highest posterior probability. A SAN, containing spectral, textural, and shape features, is used to study the Bayesian network structure, in contrast to methods which only use spectral features. The classification results of the proposed SAN-BNC are compared with those of the spectral-based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), the SAN-based MLC, and the SAN-based support vector machine (SVM) using Guangzhou as a case study.

Thus, a crucial research topic is how to design a customized product for consumers. In this study, a feature recognition and shape-design process for basketball sneakers was established that integrated Kansei engineering and artificial neural networks (ANNs), in combination with famous point guards in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as the basis for constructing a topological feature map for sneakers. We used questionnaires to get 20 fans in NBA games to assign a rating value in Kansei adjectives to evaluate 50 basketball shoes and to identify the top 10 NBA point guards. The fans??perspectives combined the psychological and physical scales for the top 10 point guards to establish a gross relationship between sneakers and the point guards. Based on competitive learning in the self organizing map (SOM), the similarities of the inputs from the Kansei perspective concerning NBA point guards and sneakers can be reduced in their dimensions and grouped into six clusters. A back propagation network (BPN) is proposed to verify the mapping of sneakers onto point guards. The results were validated by comparing them with the target neurons based on SOM feature map. A MATLAB program was developed using SOM and BPN algorithms to verify the groups of sneakers accompanying the point guards. Then, the system can categorize the sneakers that match the players. A feature-based, shape-morphing process for the design of a new style of sneaker was implemented. A model to blend the features was constructed in SolidWorks CAD by choosing any two different shapes from the SOM map. This research was used to add the vast variety of shapes and design of sneakers from the selected SOM feature map to help designers create many different styles in a short period of time.","Chung-Chuan Wang, Ching-Hu Yang, Chung-Shing Wang, Teng-Ruey Chang, Kai-Jai Yang, Feature recognition and shape design in sneakers, Computers & Industrial Engineering, Volume 102, December 2016, Pages 408-422, ISSN 0360-8352, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cie.2016.05.003.

It allows the use of electronic systems to exchange products, services and information between the different existent users. During these exchanges, it is very important to assure a good quality of service. However, the enormous expansion of the Internet users push its resources to the maximum of its limits, which provoke, in many cases, an important degradation in its performance. Consequently, it is primordial to analyze the capacity of servers in order to handle heavy workloads that are growing considerably as a function of the number of users. It is, therefore, necessary to conduct performance tests before servers' deployment in order to detect any imperfection and predict their behavior under stress. In this context, this paper present a simplified performance evaluation of the ¡°alpha¡± version of a negotiation platform called Generic Negotiation Platform (GNP) dated on September 2000. This platform is still under development. Many performance factors could be examined in this evaluation. However, we considered only the response time factor because of its important impact on auctions and negotiations applications. We mostly oriented this study to give us an idea about the variation of the average response time of the server as a function of the number of users and the type of different transactions. We also tried to evaluate the effect of the auctions' rules on the server average response time. We limited our study to the close and open auctions at the second price. This study followed the traditional way of doing performance tests. Therefore, we fixed our test objectives and criterion and then create our own scripts. Once the nature of the workload of the server was specified, we created an adequate benchmark to generate requests to the server. Afterwards, the average response time of each considered transaction was collected. In order to interpret these results properly, we calculated the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of each set of values.","Charles HÃ©lou, Rachida Dssouli, Teodor-Gabriel Crainic, Performance testing of a negotiation platform, Information and Software Technology, Volume 44, Issue 5, 1 April 2002, Pages 313-330, ISSN 0950-5849, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0950-5849(01)00215-4.

The initial target of 50,000 SHS installations in off-grid areas was achieved within 2.5 years, 3 years ahead of schedule. After achieving a revised target of 200,000 SHSs, ahead of schedule in early 2009, a new target of 1 million SHS installations by 2012 was set. The installation of about 0.5 million systems by March 2010 indicates that the current target may well be achieved before the deadline. The size of the SHS market and its impact on the regeneration of the rural economy make it necessary to investigate the quality and reliability of the installed SHSs, if the continued success of the initiative is to be maintained. This paper reports on the findings from a field-based technical appraisal of SHS installations in Bangladesh. Sixty geographically dispersed installation sites were visited. Physical characteristics of the SHSs and their system components were tested to ascertain compliance with and deviations from the approved specifications.

The themes were applied to the TB control programs of Afghanistan, DR Congo, Haiti and Somalia during the years 2000??006. Results Case notifications and treatment outcomes have increased in all four countries since 2003 (treatment success rates 81??0%). Access to care and case detection however have remained insufficient (case detection rates 39??2%); There are four lessons learned: 1. TB control programs can function in fragile states. 2. National program leadership and stewardship are essential for quality and sustained TB control. 3. Partnerships with non-governmental providers are vital for continuous service delivery; 4.

In order to make these two valorization pathways comparable three management options were analyzed whereby each part of the system was satisfied, i.e. a pest management sub-system and a cattle feed sub-system. The management options were (1) tomato pomace used for cattle feed and soil pest control using fumigant Telone II and herbicide glyphosate; (2) tomato pomace used for cattle feed and soil pest control using solarization; (3) alternative cattle feed (cottonseed, canola pellets and wheat straw) and soil pest control using biosolarization with tomato pomace. Options 2 and 3 result in a reduction of GWP and PED. Among management options, the GWP ranged from 64??8Â kg CO2-e and 1502??250Â MJ for PED per t of pomace. The majority of impacts were beyond the tomato processors??immediate control, therefore encouraging the diversion of tomato pomace to biosolarization may be desirable.

This work proposes a GPR signal processing methodology, calibrated and validated on the basis of a consistent amount of data collected by means of laboratory-scale tests, to assess the performance of the above standard test methods for GPR systems. The (theoretical) expressions of the bias and variance of the estimation error are here investigated by a reduced Taylor's expansion up to the second order. Therefore, a closed form expression for theoretically tuning the optimal threshold according to a fixed target value of the GPR signal stability is proposed.

The D2 shape descriptions of these primitives are then produced for further similarity assessments. We assess the shape similarity on a level-by-level basis between the NFTs of a query part and a candidate part. The weighted sum of the similarity values computed on each level is then used as a measure of the overall similarity between the two parts. Our approach combines the simplicity of D2 shape description while overcoming its insensitivity to negative features with NFD. It performs more consistently than the method of Convex Hull Difference (CHD).

The built environment variables used in the model are determined in a buffer zone of 300 meters around each bike sharing station. In order to estimate the bike sharing flow, we use the method of linear regression during the peak periods of a weekday. The results show that bike sharing is principally used for commuting purposes by long term subscribers while short term subscriber's trips purposes are more varied. The combination between bike sharing and train seems to be an important inter-modality. An interesting finding is that student is an important user of bike sharing. We found that there were different types of bikesharing usage which are influenced by socio-economic factors depending on the period within the day and type of subscribers. The present findings could be useful for others cities which want to adopt a bikesharing system and also for a better planning and operation of existing systems.

To enhance the proactiveness of maintenance service, the failure time of product need to be predicted. This study provides insight into how the maintenance time can be predicted accurately for the service decision-making of IPSS based on the historical failure time data, avoiding the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring. An improved grey prediction model is introduced to obtain a predictive interval of maintenance service time which is used as basis for making a decision of proactive maintenance service. The method is applied in an instance of maintenance service for agricultural machinery. In three examples of different types of agricultural machinery, the predicted intervals of maintenance time are given and the fitted values have high accordance with the real ones. The result shows that this approach can be used effectively to predict production failure time. Moreover, the output results of this approach can provide the necessary support to make a decision for proactive maintenance service without the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring in a reliable way.","Yuji Liu, Yaoguang Hu, Rui Zhou, Jingqian Wen, An Approach Based on Improved Grey Model for Predicting Maintenance Time of IPS2, Procedia CIRP, Volume 47, 2016, Pages 204-209, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2016.03.047.

Quantile regression extends the calculation to the coefficients of various quantiles, providing a more complete overview. In addition, quantile forecasting models forecast coefficients. This study proposes a new algorithm to calculate the quantile confidence intervals of the in-sample data to forecast the coefficients of the out-of-sample data. The algorithm analyzes ICT data for 78 countries between 1999 and 2010. Results show that the algorithm provides valid forecasting results and outperforms previous studies.

In the first step, we propose a SCUMN (Specific, Comprehensive, Understandable, Measurable, and Neutral) methodology to identify appropriate indicators and obtain a final list of 24 indicators according to their relevance to car sharing options. In the second step, we determine the weight of each indicator with F-AHP and conduct consistency check of the comparison matrix of selected indicators. In the third step, comparison of different options is performed with selected indicators and F-TOPSIS. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach. Twenty-four indicators are identified to evaluate five different car sharing options and rank them according to their closeness coefficients in decreasing order. And thirty-one sensitivity analysis experiments are conducted to figure out the influence of indicators on decision making. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of evaluating car sharing options with uncertainty and vagueness.

CMFD is based on the concept of Industrial Product Service System (IPS2), in which the customer, turbine supplier, and maintenance service provider are the IPS2 stakeholders. The proposed CMFD consists of signal acquisition, data transfer to the virtual diagnostics center (VDC) and fault diagnostics. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been used for fault diagnostics. CMFD has been implemented on an HPP with three Kaplan units. A signal acquisition system for CMFD consists of data acquisition from a unit control system and a supplementary system for high-frequency data acquisition. The implemented SVM method exhibits high training accuracy and thus enables adequate fault diagnostics. The data are analyzed in the VDC, which allows all stakeholders access to diagnostic information from anywhere at any time. Based on this information, the service providers can establish condition-based maintenance and offer operational support. Furthermore, through the VDC, cooperation between the stakeholders can be achieved; thus, better maintenance scheduling is possible, which will be reflected in higher system availability.","Luka Selak, Peter Butala, Alojzij Sluga, Condition monitoring and fault diagnostics for hydropower plants, Computers in Industry, Volume 65, Issue 6, August 2014, Pages 924-936, ISSN 0166-3615, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2014.02.006.

The amount information handled by this type of systems is steadily growing. Furthermore, the development of recommendation systems is a difficult task due to the implementation of complex algorithms and metrics. For this reason, the success of recommendation systems depends on preliminary design decisions such as the most adequate similarity metric, the right process to infer proactive recommendations, for mentioning a few. This decision determines the process for generating recommendations and also impacts quality and user?™s satisfaction. In this paper, we propose RESYGEN, a Recommendation System Generator. RESYGEN allows the user to generate such kind of systems in an easy and friendly way. Furthermore, RESYGEN allows the generation of multi-domain systems such as music, video, books, travel, hardware, software, and food to mention a few. RESYGEN is based in the selection of the best distance metrics for nominal, ordinal, numeric and binary attributes, with the aim to reduce complexity for non-expert users and also to facilitate the selection of the metric which best fits to the data type. A system generated through RESYGEN has several interesting elements such as ratings, recommendations, cloud tag, among others.

Pumpback operation aims at recycling a part of the down-stream discharge back to the main dam to maintain a high water level to optimise the energy value of the available water. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem to simultaneously minimise the grid pumping energy demand, minimise the wear and tear associated with the switching frequency of the pumps, maximise the restoration of the volume of the dam through pumpback operation and maximise the use of on-site generated hydrokinetic power for pumping operation. The performance of the proposed cascaded model is compared with the classical single pump pumped storage model. Simulation results based on a practical case study shows that the cascaded pumpback model can reduce the pumping energy demand by up to 48.18% and increase the energy yield of the resultant system by up to 47.10% in dry season.","Fhazhil Wamalwa, Sam Sichilalu, Xiaohua Xia, Optimal control of conventional hydropower plant retrofitted with a cascaded pumpback system powered by an on-site hydrokinetic system, Energy Conversion and Management, Volume 132, 15 January 2017, Pages 438-451, ISSN 0196-8904, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.enconman.2016.11.049.

Following enactment of the disclosure regulation in November 2000, DACCs among Taiwanese enterprises conducting transactions via offshore affiliates dropped. While the disclosure regulation helps to reduce earnings management, this study reports that such effect is asymmetric between high-tech firms and non?“high-tech firms. Specifically, the disclosure regulation is effective in reducing earnings management among firms in non?“high-tech sectors. However, such effect is not significant among firms in high-tech sectors.

The model was tested using responses from 743 Chinese consumers. Results of structural equation modeling confirmed that perceived usefulness was an antecedent of consumer attitudes toward co-creation in social media. The relationship between perceived usefulness and customer attitudes toward co-creation was moderated by the level of consumer involvement, and that relationship was found to be more salient for a high rather than a low level of consumer involvement.

Recent research and practice show that business model innovation is a promising approach for improving sustainability in manufacturing firms. To date business models have been examined mostly from the perspectives of value proposition, value capture, value creation and delivery. There is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of value in order to promote sustainability. This paper proposes value uncaptured as a new perspective for sustainable business model innovation, and develops four forms of value uncaptured: value surplus, value absence, value missed and value destroyed. This paper also proposes a framework of using value uncaptured for sustainable business model innovation. This framework has been validated in case studies in six product-service systems firms with advanced manufacturing technologies. The empirical studies identify 26 main sources of value uncaptured throughout the product life cycle. The findings show that (a) the new perspective of value uncaptured can help manufacturing firms understand the negative aspects of their business models; (b) the four forms and 26 sources can assist firms in identifying value uncaptured in a structured way; and (c) the identified value uncaptured can trigger the discovery of new value opportunities which lead to new business models with higher sustainable value. This paper extends the existing studies on business models from the perspectives of value proposition, capture, creation and delivery, to value uncaptured. The proposed framework has helped firms identify value opportunities that trigger the innovation of sustainable business models.

Case descriptions of each pharmacy were composed using data obtained via a faxed questionnaire and a follow-up telephone interview.Setting: Community and institutional pharmacies across Canada. Participants: Sixteen pharmacists with practices that met three criteria: at least one home visit conducted per week, visits conducted specifically for clinical purposes beyond routine prescription counseling, and documentation of home care services.Intervention: Faxed questionnaire and follow-up telephone interview.Main Outcome Measures: Pharmacist characteristics, pharmacy characteristics, types of clinical home care services, home care-related products and dispensing services, referral system, reimbursement, barriers and facilitators, and evaluative strategies.Results: Twelve practices were in community pharmacies, nine of them independents. Home care services were provided primarily to address noncompliance and at the request of other health professionals. Elderly patients were the predominant service recipients. Services provided in most practices included compliance support, medication regimen review, monitoring of new medications, and patient education and training. Less than one-third of practices compiled evaluative data on these services. Most practices did not bill for services rendered. Lack of reimbursement was cited as the most important practice barrier, and having other sources of funding, such as high prescription revenues, was viewed as the major facilitator.Conclusion: Clinical home care practice is rare in Canadian pharmacy; reimbursement is a major barrier. Practices described in these case studies were initiated to address a perceived important patient need. To enable further dissemination of clinical home care practice, pharmacists need to establish formal linkages with other home care providers, evaluate their services, and use the data obtained to develop marketing and reimbursement strategies.","Linda D.

To estimate the spillover effects, we employ bivariate GARCH models, assuming both constant and dynamic conditional correlation specifications. At the aggregate market level, we find unidirectional mean and volatility spillovers from the US to the Israeli market. For the portfolios of Israeli cross-listed stocks, we report significant spillovers, at both the mean and volatility levels, from the underlying stocks in the Israeli market to their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) but not vice versa. Thus, the home market dominates the host market in the price discovery process in this atypical international cross-listing case, providing new evidence in support of the home bias hypothesis.

Therefore, the underlying concept of culture within current servitization studies promotes predominantly cultural consistence and coherence, possible variability's, ambiguities and paradoxes are to a greater extent omitted. Analysing and questioning the underlying concepts of culture within servitization research to this point, this paper will shed light on the question, how a comprehensive understanding of organizational culturecan offer further insights to support theservitization process of companies. Two concepts of culture that are linked to path research serve as a theoretical foundation: The first concept identifies organizational culture as a promoter of path dependence and therefore as an inhibiting factor within the servitization process. The role of agents is perceived rather passive within this view. The second concept of organizational culture stresses the role of culture as a promoter of path creation and therefore as an enabling factor within the servitization process. According to this view, social agents can actively use cultural means to create new paths for the organization. On this basis aconceptual framework for analysing organizational culture within servitization will be introduced that comprises the dimensions a.) path constitution, b.) role of agents and c) manifestations of culture. This framework embraces the ambiguity of culture within the transformation process as both, an inhibiting factor, as a culture that needs to be changed,and as an enabling factor, as a culture of change.","Antje Lienert, Change of Culture or Culture of Change?

Design/methodology/approach This study uses survey methodology to examine a research model with six hypotheses. Data from 149 high-tech firms are analyzed using structural equation modeling. Findings The dialogic co-creation affects customer relationship strength (relational resource), valuation of knowledge (informational resource), and capability of customization (organizational resource), facilitating service innovation. Research limitations/implications Findings offer novel insights into how service innovation co-creation takes place within a dialogic context leading to organizational changes. The results clarify the influences of operant resources on service innovation and indicate that companies should emphasize dialogic communication with customer in developing service innovation. Practical implications Managers have to understand that co-creation is an effective approach in business to stretch business boundaries, and that customers are the crucial external party that co-creates. According to the mutual influences of co-creation, businesses not only can exploit knowledge from customers but also strengthen the relationship bond with them. For the investment programs on service innovation of businesses, managers should allocate budget to relation-specific investments and knowledge acquisition with customers.

Development of clusters is a dynamic process shaped by a variety of internal and external factors such as availability of skilled labor, presence of functioning networks and partnerships, technological changes, and market competition, etc. As a result, the patterns of cluster growth may differ from one another. Although each cluster is unique in some way, previous research has attempted to identify few simplified models of evolution of clusters. In this study, we briefly reviewed the literature on a variety of models of clusters. Based on these models, we investigated 15 hi-performing metropolitan-based clusters in the United States, covering communications equipment manufacturing, information technology, and biopharmaceutical industries, in order to find out the similarities and differences between real-world clusters. Specifically, by examining the composition of these high-tech clusters, we attempted to find out the following: 1) What are the typologies of these technology clusters? 2) Whether different industries tend to support different cluster typologies? and 3) How do clusters change their typologies over time? Our analysis results suggest that the real-world clusters rarely feature any single type of typology; a mixed type of typology is much more prevalent in reality.","Jiang He, M.

In sustainable business design, it is crucial to consider interaction between the core business and external environment, which does not seem to influence the profit of the core business but necessary to explain their intended environmental and social value proposition. To construct a particular model of sustainable business, the paper conducted a survey on the study of business models and, in particular, sustainable business models (e.g., eco-innovations, sustainable innovations, product-service systems). The survey focuses on how the study models external environment and its influences on the core business characterized by ?œexternality?? Through discussion on the findings of the literature review, three key issues to be addressed for constructing sustainable business model are identified: taxonomy of externality, identification of a set of models (i.e., aspect model), and identification of interrelationship among them. First and second issues clarify particular aspects of externality.

The article achieves this through empirical research into a process of ecodesign decision-making in a single firm. The study spans a timeframe of nine years. The article describes how recognising and dealing with ecodesign dilemmas fuels cycles of learning, leading the firm towards business model innovation. The study classifies a unique set of ecodesign dilemmas: hierarchies; tensions; contradictions; and oversights. Through this classification, we show how firms need to adopt a unified approach combining operational (ecodesign principles approach), tactical (ecodesign management processes) and strategic actions (business model innovation), to systematically manage ecodesign dilemmas. To support this, the article presents a framework describing key actions for operational, tactical and strategic ecodesign decision-making and the types of ecodesign dilemmas typical to each approach. Through this study, we show that the business model is critical to inform effective ecodesign decision-making and illustrate how design can drive firms towards sustainable change, from the bottom up.","Sharon M.

In increasingly turbulent business environments?”characterized by complexity, scarce resources, and escalating competitive opportunities and threats?”firms are forced to alter intended and realize emergent strategies more frequently than ever before. The eventualities of realized marketing strategies may lead to misalignments between the strategy and the existing administrative system designed to support it. To examine performance implications of such misalignments we use Slater and Olson's (2001) taxonomy of marketing strategies. We distinguish between intended and realized plans and we propose an administrative system framework of structural (i.e., centralization, formalization, and specialization) and dynamic (i.e., interdepartmental connectedness and strategic control mechanisms) parameters for the effective implementation of realized strategies. We propose three-way interactions between realized marketing strategies and the dynamic parameters of the system. Research hypotheses on performance implications and responses from 215 marketing executives show performance differences across strategy types and (mis)alignments of the administrative system. Our findings confirm three-way interactions among strategy types, interdepartmental connectedness, and control mechanisms for all realized strategy types.","Simos Chari, George Balabanis, Matthew J.

The present study contributes to a better understanding of the transition process from traditional transaction-oriented roles to future co-creation roles within provider?“customer relationships. Our inductive analysis of cross-comparative case studies, including eight provider?“customer relationships, identifies significant role ambiguities among actors involved in this transition. In addition to identifying challenges, we explain how relational coping strategies help the partners manage the presence of role ambiguities during the value co-creation process. Notably, three types of role ambiguities (vague role expectations, unclear role descriptions and uncertain role scripts) often serve as barriers to co-creating value across different phases of the value co-creation process and require different relational response strategies (role clarification, role redefinition and role adaption) to cope with unclear expectations, responsibilities and demands.

However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on Open Data Business Models (ODBMs) are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of ODBMs which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. This has made the understanding of value creation and exploitation mechanisms in existing open data businesses difficult and challenging to transfer. Following the Design Science Research (DSR) tradition, we developed a 6-Value (6-V) business model framework as a design artifact to facilitate the explication and detailed analysis of existing ODBMs in practice. Based on the results from the analysis, we identify business model patterns and emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses.

However, in many markets the role of purchasing is just as important. This paper uses a case study to examine how a single buying company can attempt to shape an emerging market through its purchasing practices. As a result, the study identifies five types of market-shaping actions. Within each action type, the market-shaping behavior of a buyer in an emerging market can be very diverse and include internal actions as well as actions aimed at influencing other market actors. While agency on the purchasing side is often associated with large size organizations, namely government and public sector agencies, our case study shows that agencies on the purchasing sides can be deployed in a variety of ways rather than merely through raw bargaining power. The findings indicate that buying firms do not simply adjust their own purchasing processes according to existing offerings, but actively attempt to drive market evolution in particular directions.","Pauliina Ulkuniemi, Luis Araujo, Jaana TÃ¤htinen, Purchasing as market-shaping: The case of component-based software engineering, Industrial Marketing Management, Volume 44, January 2015, Pages 54-62, ISSN 0019-8501, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.indmarman.2014.10.007.

The study focuses on mechanisms that technology transfer offices (TTOs) and universities employ to foster spin-offs. These mechanisms include technology transfer activities that support spin-offs, normative frameworks, support infrastructures (i.e., business incubators and science parks), and TTO staff's specialist technical skills. The analysis also differentiates between public and private universities. Spin-offs belong to one or more of the following groups: spin-offs with support from the university's TTO, spin-offs operating under a license agreement, and spin-offs in which the TTO or university holds equity. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of 2011 data from 63 Spanish universities (46 public and 17 private) identifies recipes of antecedent conditions that effectively foster spin-offs. Results show that no unique combination of antecedent conditions yields more university spin-offs than any other does.

"201","Topic_3",0.468181818181818,"The concept of improvisation is discussed in management literature as a promising mechanism and design principle for an organization's capacity for learning, adaptability and innovation. However, a specific form of improvisation for coping with the duality of production and service has not yet been applied to the servitization of manufacturing or PSS. This paper introduces a specific form of semi-structured improvisational learning related to PSS-oriented organizations. It introduces an organizational design principle of desired and accepted improvisational actions for highly individualized customer solutions. This semi-structured form of improvisational learning separates PSS from manufacturing-oriented organizations, where improvisation is rather a phenomenon of resistive actions that trigger undesired deviations. By emphasizing the increasing importance of improvisation and improvisational learning as a desirable and acceptable principle of action, it is argued that this rather paradigmatic shift demands specific capabilities from individual actors in PSS. These individual capabilities are summarized in this paper as learning-oriented capabilities that unfold a dynamic balance of generative and adaptive learning activities in PSS. As this specific pattern of individual capabilities is less cultivated in pure manufacturing, a game-based training and learning approach is introduced which is designed to accompany individual actors during the servitization process. The game-based learning scenario focuses on the development of individual improvisational capabilities as a mediating force in the dynamic triangle of customer, production and service. In conclusion, the literature review of this paper contributes to the scientific community by framing the servitization of manufacturing with the concept of improvisation as a coping strategy for the dynamics and ambiguity in PSS. Furthermore, a training and development approach is specified that aims at equipping individual actors with capabilities of improvisation and improvisational learning as prerequisites for the operation of highly individualized PSS. This training approach is also intended to be applicable for practitioners.","Thomas SÃ¼ÃŸe, Improvisation as a Prerequisite for the Dynamic Interplay of Production and Service in PSS: Insights of an Organizational Design Principle and a Game-based Learning Approach, Procedia CIRP, Volume 30, 2015, Pages 366-371, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2015.02.186.

In this emerging context, knowledge is considered as a foundation for value co-creation. Therefore, identifying different types of issues, with which value network actors in knowledge transfer are confronted, is conceived as a first step toward, on the one hand, the prevention of the failure of knowledge exchange initiatives in a network, and on the other hand, the enhancement of the collaborative process of knowledge sharing. This requires shifting the conventional approach on knowledge transfer issues from an intra-organizational to an inter-organizational network. This paper aims to systematically identify and classify knowledge transfer issues with both tacit and explicit knowledge considerations. In doing so, we have first conducted a systematic literature review to identify issues. Secondly, these issues have been classified into six main categories and 29 subcategories through a structured classification approach. The proposed classification framework provides a comprehensive and wide spectrum of possible issues related to knowledge transfer within a value network.

However, the overall volume of literature dedicated to DfRem is low and there is still much to learn about the subject. The purpose of this literature review is to collate the current body of literature and establish a contemporary understanding of DfRem through analysing the trends, agreements and conflicts of opinion in the field. Much of the DfRem literature to date is focused upon the investigation of remanufacturing problems associated with product design, and the subsequent development of design methods and tools, either specifically developed to aid DfRem or as adaptations of existing design methods. These methods and tools vary in purpose and intended use but all largely remain within the academic realm to date. Within the literature there is widespread agreement that any approach to DfRem must consider both product and process, yet the ?˜design for X??definition of the task continues to spark debate. The key problems and issues that future DfRem research should address have been identified in this paper, from both within the literature and from the current gaps in the literature.

An IPS2 includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the IPS2 development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of IPS2 requires various competences. Consequently, the IPS2 provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of IPS2 business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the IPS2 lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the ICS is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the ICS focuses on intangibles, its application to the IPS2 context appears reasonable. The main difference by using ICS for IPS2 is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the ICS from the system boundary of one firm to an IPS2 and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an ICS is necessary in the context of IPS2 and what adjustments are required in order to adapt ICS for IPS2.","Jakub Wewior, Solmaz Alevifard, Holger Kohl, Marion Steven, GÃ¼nther Seliger, Intellectual Capital Statement in IPS2, Procedia CIRP, Volume 16, 2014, Pages 301-307, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2014.02.017.

A great amount of literature work has been devoted to PSS issues, but there is fairly limited published work on integrated and easily applicable evaluation methodologies for PSS design, as well as lack of Lean PSS approaches. Contributing to these directions, the present work introduces a conceptual methodology for the evaluation and improvement of the PSS design procedure using key performance indicators (KPIs) and Lean rules respectively, applied throughout all stages of PSS design lifecycle. The methodology contains two phases: i) PSS design evaluation, and ii) Lean PSS design assistance. According to the evaluation phase, a certain appropriate set of KPIs is selected and suggested to the PSS designer via a context sensitivity analysis (CSA) tool through a pool of 170 KPIs, which have been identified after intensive literature survey, and systematically classified into four main categories: Design, Manufacturing, Customer, and Environmental. From the collected and classified KPIs, a successive grouping is carried out of those KPIs that contribute to the Sustainability of the designed PSS offering. During the phase of Lean design assistance, Lean Rules are selected using CSA, and suggested to the designer at all design steps to ensure the minimization of wasteful activities. Enabler for the context awareness is the availability of feedback gathered from the manufacturing, shop-floor experts and the different types of Customers (Business or final-product Customers), as well as the PSS lifecycle stages which the designer treats. An ontology knowledge model for KPIs and Lean rules is proposed to support the CSA. The methodology is discussed in a case study of the PSS design from a mould-making industry.","Dimitris Mourtzis, Sophia Fotia, Ekaterini Vlachou, PSS Design Evaluation via KPIs and Lean Design Assistance Supported by Context Sensitivity Tools, Procedia CIRP, Volume 56, 2016, Pages 496-501, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2016.10.097.

One of the major challenges is the integrated development of both tangible products and intangible services in respect to their interdependencies. For this reason researchers proposed a versatile set of methods and tools regarding the development of PSS. Nevertheless, two discrepancies can be stated: Firstly, prototyping has been studied inadequately in PSS research so far. For this reason Exner et al. proposed new approaches to fill this gap [2], including remarks to further proceed research with different degrees of technological utilization. Secondly, although customer-orientation and customer integration has been recognized as crucial for PSS, the involvement of clients or consumers in the design process is often disregarded. Consequently, this paper presents an extensive literature research regarding active customer integration and prototyping in PSS design processes. Based on these insights a concept for a new PSS prototyping approach is introduced.

The development of Product Service Systems (PSS) is a solution that has been discussed by the academia in recent years, resulting in an increasing number of publications. The literature not only shows a growing interest in PSS but also points out some research gaps such as the lack of characterization of a PSS and the difficulty of identifying a PSS. In this sense, this paper proposes an application of a framework that characterizes a PSS in a real situation. The aim is to check if the real situation presents the characteristics of a PSS highlighted by the framework. The framework presents conceptual elements throughout the life cycle of a PSS: Requirements definition of a PSS; Development of a PSS; Implementation of a PSS; Monitoring a PSS; and Post-use disposal of a PSS. These elements are intended to identify the characteristics of PSS for each stage of the cycle. The real situation identified in the existing literature on PSS presents basic characteristics of a PSS, it contains its four main factors: product, service, actors network and infrastructure and presents the similarity of the three types of PSS (product-oriented, use-oriented and results-oriented). Thus, the framework is applied in the practical case to identify characteristics of PSS. This application is carried from a questionnaire based on conceptual elements arranged in stages of the life cycle of the PSS. The responses were analyzed highlighting main conceptual elements characteristics. With the information obtained from the questionnaire, the results demonstrate the company's current situation and the PSS characteristics that could be implemented.","Fernanda HÃ¤nsch Beuren, Delcio Pereira, Alexandre Borges Fagundes, Product-service Systems Characterization Based on Life Cycle: Application in a Real Situation, Procedia CIRP, Volume 47, 2016, Pages 418-423, ISSN 2212-8271, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procir.2016.03.116.

It exhibits dynamic nature and is multidimensional, since a large network of stakeholders are usually involved in the design and development of PSS eco-systems and their influence must be considered during the evaluation of the PSS offering. Nevertheless, an effective PSS evaluation can determine the market success of the PSS offering, leading to fewer design modifications and shortened time-to-market. Still, existing literature lacks an exhaustive review and classification of PSS evaluation approaches. Moreover, a lack of critical in-depth validation of performance approaches in real industrial environments is observed. Towards bridging this gap, the present work identifies the most important perspectives in the PSS ecosystem, such as supplier selection and service level, and discusses the utilised evaluation approaches used for each of them.

At the same time, PSS require robust engineering methods and tools for their design, which allow multi-dimensional exchange of knowledge between the designers and the relevant stakeholders across the value chain. Currently, enabling technologies such as Cloud technology, social media and networking, knowledge management, and context sensitivity present new possibilities to enhance the knowledge exchange and the collaborative process of PSS design. These technologies allow the gathering and analysis of big volumes of data from scattered heterogeneous IT systems and, at the same time, allow PSS design improvements by processing the experiences of the business customers, consumers, designers, shop-floor, and provide feedback to the design phase. However, a number of challenges are encountered during the gathering, visualization, monitoring, and assessment of related data, such as the lack of context sensitivity.

Some environmental impacts can vary depending on the characteristics of their surroundings, and therefore on the location of the activity. This variability can be taken into account in environmental assessment using spatialized LCA. Spatial differentiation is especially relevant when studying territories (ca. 100??0,000Â km2), which often have high heterogeneity in environmental characteristics. In this study, we developed a method for spatialized territorial LCA (STLCA) that combines spatialized LCA and territorial LCA to study land-use planning in an agricultural territory. An agricultural territory is defined as a geographically delimited area in which the majority of land use or economic activity is based on agriculture. STLCA can estimate potential environmental impacts of an agricultural territory for land-planning purposes, such as which agricultural activities should be developed and where to locate them. The method consists of six steps: (1) defining boundaries and functions of the territory under study and identifying the human activities to include, (2) defining and locating activity and environment typologies within the territory, (3) determining the spatialized life cycle inventory by locating emissions using regional data, if possible, (4) determining spatialized life cycle impact assessment for all regional impacts considered, (5) mapping impacts inside and outside the territory, and finally (6) analyzing results using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Objectives of this method are to (1) give more accurate results than a territorial LCA without spatial differentiation, (2) help decrease environmental impacts within a territory while avoiding transfer of impacts to other territories and (3) help avoid or minimize impacts of exchanges of resources or products with other territories.","Laure Nitschelm, JoÃ«l Aubin, Michael S.

However how to quantify the impact of industrial symbiosis on improving the sustainability of an industrial park is rarely studied. This study proposed an emergy analysis to conduct an assessment on Hefei economic and technological development area to quantify the performance of industrial symbiosis. Comparing with conventional evaluation methods, emergy analysis can reflect the real contribution of local ecosystem by focusing on nature's free investment, not only the economic value or the resources supplied to the industrial system. Research results show that industrial symbiosis operations improve the study area's sustainable development ability by 33%. Specifically, non-renewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 99.71%, 25.64%, and 9.82%, and the ratio of the money saving to the total gross domestic product of the industrial park would be 29.71%. By examining industrial symbiosis practices in detail within the system, this paper can describe the process of the industrial symbiosis and how these industrial symbiosis practices influence the overall performance of the industrial park. This study indicates that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce raw materials and energy consumption and improve the overall sustainability, which can help policy-makers make decisions.","Yupeng Fan, Qi Qiao, Lin Fang, Yang Yao, Emergy analysis on industrial symbiosis of an industrial park ??A case study of Hefei economic and technological development area, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 141, 10 January 2017, Pages 791-798, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.159.

This research evaluated the sustainability of China?™s cement industry in 2010 using emergy analysis. Several emergy based indicators were adopted to describe the comprehensive performance of this system from different angles, including Percentage of renewability (%R), Unit emergy value (UEV), Emergy yield ratio (EYR), Emergy exchange ratio (EER), Environmental load ratio (ELR) and Emergy sustainable index (ESI). The research results show that (1) Mineral resources have absolute contribution to China?™s cement production; (2) Coal is the main energy source for China?™s cement industry; (3) China?™s cement industry has relatively weak competition ability due to relatively high ratio of purchased inputs; (4) China?™s other industries have benefited greatly from this industry by exchanges; (5) China?™s cement industry cannot keep sustainable in the long run due to its high environmental load; (6) the UEV of Chinese cement in 2010 is 3.64E15 sej/t (based on the emergy baseline 15.83E24 sej/yr).

Technologies for energetic valorization of waste tires were reviewed and two alternatives based on updraft gasification in a modified reactor design were proposed. First of all, a large-scale updraft gasifier on IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) was considered for the gasification of the derived fuel from waste tires, capable to produce between 10.8 and 16.1 MJ of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. The second alternative considered a small-scale updraft gasifier feeding an internal combustion engine, coupled to an electricity generator for the production of up to 8.2 MJ of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. Implementation of these technologies will allow energetic valorization of waste tires in Brazil, solving their disposal problems, creating jobs, reducing negative disposal environmental impacts in landfills, and increasing distributed generation of electricity.","Einara Blanco Machin, Daniel Travieso Pedroso, JoÃ£o Andrade de Carvalho Jr., Energetic valorization of waste tires, Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews, Volume 68, Part 1, February 2017, Pages 306-315, ISSN 1364-0321, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.rser.2016.09.110.

The utilization of agricultural residues as raw materials in a biorefinery is a promising alternative to fossil resources for production of energy carriers and chemicals, thus mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security. This paper focuses on a biorefinery concept which produces bioethanol, bioenergy and biochemicals from two types of agricultural residues, corn stover and wheat straw. These biorefinery systems are investigated using a Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) approach, which takes into account all the input and output flows occurring along the production chain. This approach can be applied to almost all the other patterns that convert lignocellulosic residues into bioenergy and biochemicals. The analysis elaborates on land use change aspects, i.e. the effects of crop residue removal (like decrease in grain yields, change in soil N2O emissions and decrease of soil organic carbon). The biorefinery systems are compared with the respective fossil reference systems producing the same amount of products/services from fossils instead of biomass. Since climate change mitigation and energy security are the two most important driving forces for biorefinery development, the assessment focuses on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative primary energy demand, but other environmental categories are evaluated as well.","Francesco Cherubini, Sergio Ulgiati, Crop residues as raw materials for biorefinery systems ??A LCA case study, Applied Energy, Volume 87, Issue 1, January 2010, Pages 47-57, ISSN 0306-2619, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apenergy.2009.08.024.

However, LCIA does not always provide valuable information for choosing among alternatives with different specifications, functionalities and lifetimes. The objectives of this study are (1) to propose environmental indicators to evaluate environmental efficiency and value qualitatively and quantitatively on the basis of analogies to financial and economic indicators, and (2) to present the application of the indicators. Incremental evaluation using a reference is employed to obtain the environmental indicators. The environmental efficiency indicators are conceptually based on the ratios of reduced environmental burdens returned to environmental burdens required: environmental return on investment, environmental payback period and environmental internal rate of return. The environmental value indicator is the sum of all reduced and required environmental burdens: i.e., environmental net present value. All the environmental indicators can be used to compare and rank the environmental efficiencies or values of alternatives. The environmental efficiency indicators can be applied to a new environmental labeling. The concept of eco-efficiency labeling is developed by combining the environmental efficiency indicators with financial indicators. A case study is performed to illustrate the necessity and importance of the environmental indicators.

The results indicate that, out of all of the vehicles, electric vehicles are the most competitive?”from both an ecological and economic perspective. Moreover, of all of the business models, Car Pooling is the most competitive when driving short to medium distances, reducing CO2 emissions by 20??0% compared with Regular Purchasing. Meanwhile, Car Leasing emits the same amount of CO2 emissions as Regular Purchasing if both are driven the same number of kilometers per year. The results also indicate that, from a cost effectiveness perspective, people who travel less than 2000Â km per year should primarily consider using Taxis or similar services, while Car Pooling is most cost effective for those who travel from 2000 to 8500Â km. For those who travel between 8500 and 13,500Â km per year, Car Leasing is the most cost effective, and Regular Purchasing is the best option above 13,500Â km per year. If most car owners were to accept and adapt to this identified need for a market move towards Car Pooling with Electric Vehicles, necessary transportation could be ensured while significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, whether from Regular Purchasing or Car Leasing, as well as those that run on fossil fuel.

Within e-waste, the life cycle of the mobile phone product system is particularly important because of: (1) the increasing quantities of mobile phones in this waste flow; and (2) the sustainability challenges associated with the emerging economies of reuse, refurbishment, and export of used mobile phones. This study examined the possibilities of closing the material flow loop in the global mobile phone product system (GMPPS) while addressing the broad sustainability challenges linked to recovery of materials. This was done using an adapted system dynamics modeling approach to investigate the dominant paths and drivers for closing the metal flow loop through the concept of eco-cycle. Two indicators were chosen to define the closed loop system: loop leakage and loop efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of selected parameters was used to identify potential drivers for closing the metal flow loop. The modeling work indicated leverage for management strategies aimed at closing the loop in: (i) collection systems for used phones, (ii) mobile phone use time, and (ii) informal recycling in developing countries. By analyzing the dominant parameters, an eco-cycle scenario that could promote a closed loop system by decreasing pressures on virgin materials was formulated. Improved policy support and product service systems could synchronize growth between upstream producers and end-of-life organizations and help achieve circular production and consumption in the GMPPS.","Rajib Sinha, Rafael Laurenti, Jagdeep Singh, Maria E.

The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a ?œgreen economy?? Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required.

"520","Topic_5",0.49468085106383,"The Circular Economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a Circular Economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas?”design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education?”with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.","M.

"585","Topic_5",0.491596638655462,"In this proof of concept paper, we address the potential role of forests and vegetation cover as an adaptation tool. In contrast to work addressing the carbon benefits of afforestation, we highlight the potential usefulness of forests as major contributors to the water cycle. Integrating water and carbon cycle benefits into a common objective enhances discussions about the role and value of forests. Herein, we describe a method for increasing regional precipitation in semi-arid environments, thereby potentially helping to increase scarce water resources. The approach capitalizes on observed interactions between forest cover and the hydrologic cycle, with the express aim of returning much needed water resources to an increasingly vulnerable region. The natural processes behind ?œprecipitation recycling??(PR), and vegetation based cross continental transport of atmospheric moisture form the core of this solution. Induced precipitation recycling (IPR) initiates these processes by irrigating afforested land using locally available surplus water. This paper discusses the underlying processes and a proposed demonstration project that functions as both a ?œproof of concept??and a research testing ground, providing potential validation for promoting future expansion to the wider region. The proposed IPR project utilizes treated wastewater and surplus storm run-off, thus averting additional burdens on the existing water supply, while performing additionally valuable environmental and ecosystem services. IPR provides an alternative approach to supplement existing and typically far costlier plans to address regional water shortages and handle wastewater treatment. The proposed integrated solution would not only contribute positively to regional water supply, but would also provide additional eco-system services and end-products that add value and utility, thereby improving the project?™s potential economic viability.

The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. In the first paper of this tandem publication, the authors propose a new generic process model embedding the Framework of Strategic Sustainable Development. The purpose of applying it in an action-research mode as described in this paper was twofold: (i) to develop a vision for sustainable regional transport and a coarse roadmap towards that vision, and, while doing so, (ii) get additional empirical experiences to inform the development of the new generic process model. Experts from many sectors and organizations involved in the GreenCharge project provided vital information and reviewed all planning perspectives presented in Paper 1 in two sequential multi-stakeholder seminars. The results include a sustainable vision for electric vehicle systems in southeast Sweden within a sustainable regional transport system within a sustainable global society, as well as an initial development plan towards such a vision for the transport sector. The vision is framed by the universal sustainability principles, and the development plan is informed by the strategic guidelines, of the above-mentioned framework. Among other things, the vision and plan imply a shift to renewable energy and a more optimized use of areas and thus a new type of spatial planning. For example, the vision and plan implies a lower built-in demand for transport, more integrated traffic modes, and more multi-functional use of areas for energy and transport infrastructures, for example. Some inherent benefits of electric vehicles are highlighted in the vision and plan, including near-zero local emissions and flexibility as regards primary energy sources. The vision and plan also imply improved governance for more effective cross-sector collaboration to ensure coordinated development within the transport sector and between the transportation sector and other relevant sectors. Meanwhile, the new generic process model was refined and is ready to be applied and further tested in the GreenCharge project and in other projects within the transport sector as well as other sectors. The study confirmed that the new generic process model suggested in support of sustainable transport system and community development is helpful for giving diverse stakeholders, with various specialties and perspectives, a way of working that is goal-oriented and builds on effective, iterative learning loops and co-creation.","Sven BorÃ©n, Lisiana Nurhadi, Henrik Ny, Karl-Henrik RobÃ¨rt, GÃ¶ran Broman, Louise Trygg, A strategic approach to sustainable transport system development ??Part 2: the case of a vision for electric vehicle systems in southeast Sweden, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 140, Part 1, 1 January 2017, Pages 62-71, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.02.055.

In 2009, 60% of the world?™s champagne cork stoppers were produced in Catalonia, due to the importance of cava, champagne and other sparkling wines in neighbouring areas. The aim of this research was to provide environmental reference data on champagne cork stoppers production, and identify the industrial stages and operations that made the greatest impact. This research was carried out using Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) methodology, and five of the most representative producers were analysed. The system considered all the processes involved in production after the forest management stage and one million champagne cork stoppers were taken as a functional unit (FU).","JesÃºs Rives, Ivan FernÃ¡ndez-RodrÃ­guez, Joan Rieradevall, Xavier Gabarrell, Environmental analysis of the production of champagne cork stoppers, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 25, April 2012, Pages 1-13, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2011.12.001.

"684","Topic_5",0.467592592592593,"With the Waste Framework Directive in 2008, waste prevention was promoted as the first priority. However, the actual implementation of waste prevention activities has so far been hesitant, and the focus on end-of-pipe waste management such as recycling prevails. The objective of this study is to explore key factors that influence engagement in waste prevention activities, thus helping to clarify why waste prevention, although adopted at both the European and national levels, has so far not been successfully implemented. We investigate the status quo, potentials of and barriers to waste prevention within local authorities in Germany and identify measures for waste prevention.  An extensive literature review emphasizes that the overall implementation status of waste prevention is low, which is partially due to an apparent lack of guidance for practitioners. Our empirical study investigates possible reasons and provides solution-oriented insights on how to encourage activity. The study is based on a survey simultaneously addressing 386 Bavarian municipalities by questionnaire and on personal interviews with 33 executives and employees of public administration from three different local authorities.  Results verify that the implementation status of waste prevention measures among local authorities is generally low. Only 10% of all cities are about to establish waste prevention as a criterion in public procurement. The estimation of waste prevention potentials varies depending on the waste stream. A total of 70% of all respondents evaluate the potential for waste prevention of typical recycling materials, such as paper and plastic, as high or very high, while waste from building materials and construction components is considered to be hardly preventable. Main barriers are the low acceptance for waste prevention activities and a lack of information. A total of 25% of all interview partners felt that environmental awareness in general is a mandatory condition for behavioral change.","Petra Hutner, Andrea Thorenz, Axel Tuma, Waste prevention in communities: A comprehensive survey analyzing status quo, potentials, barriers and measures, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 141, 10 January 2017, Pages 837-851, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2016.09.156.

"528","Topic_5",0.467455621301775,"Forests are the most important resource of our planet. The usefulness of forests is spread from commercial exploitation of them for timber and other products to maintenance of wildlife, ecological balance, prevention of soil erosion, etc. In achieving these goals the essential factor is the proper forest management. Forest management is a system of actions for supplying different products and services for society. In developed countries forest management tends to be elaborated and planned in order to achieve the objectives that are considered desirable for environment and economy. Forests are the most biologically diverse land ecosystems that can supply different products and services. The working of this system is influenced by the natural environment, climate, topography, soil, etc., and also by human action. Forests have been and are managed to obtain the traditional forest products: fire wood, fiber for paper, building timber etc. with little thinking for other products and services. Nevertheless, as a result from the development of ecology science and environmental awareness, management of forests for multiple use is becoming more common. Public concern regarding forest management have shifted from the extraction of timber for earning money for the economy, to the preservation of additional forest resources, including wildlife, soil and water conservation, recreation etc. Forests are the repositories of aesthetic, ethical cultural and religious values.","T.

"628","Topic_5",0.452296819787986,"At the Delft University of Technology, a new model has been developed to describe the sustainability of products, the ?˜EVR model?? This model comprises two concepts:??the ?˜virtual eco-costs??as a LCA-based single indicator for environmental impact ??the EVR (Eco-costs/Value Ratio) as an indicator for eco-efficiency   In this publication, an experiment is described to test whether the EVR model leads to a good understanding of the eco-efficiency, of a product?“service combination. In this experiment three separate groups of 8-11 people were asked to rank four alternative solutions of a product?“service system (the after sales service and the maintenance service of an induction plate cooker) both in terms of sustainability and of general preference. The three respective groups were:??customers (among whom representatives of consumer organizations) ??business representatives from the manufacturing company of the induction plate cookers ??governmental representatives (employees of the Dutch ministries of environmental affairs and economic affairs, and of the Dutch provinces as well as consultants involved in governmental policies), all experts in the field of sustainability   The basic idea was to ask each group to rank the four alternatives after three levels of information input: Level 1: basic explanation of the four alternatives. Some major features and characteristics such as price were given, but no environmental data.  Level 2: on explanation of an LCA of the four alternatives, given in nine impact classes and the Eco-indicator 95.  Level 3: an explanation of the EVR model and the EVR data of the four alternatives.   Each time the group was asked to rank the proposed alternatives in terms of expected environmental performance and of ?˜best choice in general??(?˜Which system would you have bought in a real life situation???.  From the experiments it can be concluded that:??The concept of eco-costs was accepted by the majority of the non-experts: they based their ranking on it. and they preferred it rather than direct LCA output or the damage based eco-indicator 95 data. ??The environmental experts in the governmental group did not directly accept the concept of eco-costs model (they wanted in depth information first); they tended to stick to their existing knowledge of LCA data and the Eco-indicator 95. ???˜Overall??preferences of the customers and business representatives were primarily ranked on the ?˜perceived value??costs ratio of the product?“service combination; the sustainability of the product?“service combination played a secondary role.","Joost G VogtlÃ¤nder, Arianne Bijma, Han C Brezet, Communicating the eco-efficiency of products and services by means of the eco-costs/value model, Journal of Cleaner Production, Volume 10, Issue 1, February 2002, Pages 57-67, ISSN 0959-6526, http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0959-6526(01)00013-0.
