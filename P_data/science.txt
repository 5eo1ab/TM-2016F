Abstract: Abstract
The objective of the research is to develop novel tools for engineering of Product Service Systems around products, which possess cyber physical features. The products with cyber physical features, such as vehicles, machines, home appliances, offer large spectrum of opportunities to provide new services around such products. The analysis of the state of the art indicate that engineering tools to support effective engineering of services around such products, are still missing. Two new engineering tools directly supporting development of the product service systems are developed a tool for selection /definition of sensors and intelligent features at the products for building services and tools for embedding context sensitivity into products and services. The research is driven by industrial application scenarios addressing different aspects of product-services systems as well as products development in different sectors (automotive, home appliances, automation equipment etc.). In this paper the focus is on an application scenario in automation equipment industry.

Abstract: Abstract
The tool and die making industry from Western Europe, characterized by single and small series production, faces increasing global competition with low-wage countries. Challenges are the increasing product-derivatization, shorter product life-cycles and lower factor costs of global competitors. The Western European high quality tool and die making industry is not able to face the increasing cost pressure, caused by the international competition, by reducing the acquisition price. Therefore prices are insufficient as a differentiation criterion. However, differentiation is possible through individual services replenishing the product. The solution presented in this paper concerns the configuration of a customized life-cycle-oriented Product-Service-System that incorporates product and service modules to address clients’ preferences.

Abstract: Abstract
Product service systems (PSS), which generate higher value by integrating physical products and services, have attracted much attention in the manufacturing industry. To design a PSS, initiating companies need to explore various PSS options at the conceptual design stage. However, our PSS design workshops have revealed that traditional product-selling manufacturers rarely include PSS options because a PSS, which includes many service elements, is far from their traditional business. This study proposes a task management framework that enables manufacturers to develop various PSS options from their product-selling business. The proposed framework provides designers with viewpoints and checklists for a PSS design. The effectiveness of the framework is demonstrated through an example case.

Abstract: Abstract
Since customer acceptance is responsible for the success of innovative products, this study investigates how Product-Service Systems (PSS) influence customer acceptance of innovations. Using the example of electric vehicles (EV) in carpools, interviews were held with four PSS providers and four PSS customers from Germany and Sweden. The results of the interviews were then analyzed according to Rogers’ theory of the diffusion of innovations: Providing innovative products as PSS can increase customer acceptance by reducing performance gaps that exist between innovative and existing technologies. The main gaps found with EVs are their limited range and high purchase costs. Customers perceive those gaps as less considerable if they rent EVs in a carpool.

Abstract: Abstract
Systematic development is of utmost importance for the market success of Product-Service Systems (PSSs). A multitude of methods and processes to support the development of PSS has already been published. Yet empirical studies in this context prove that the level of utilization of methods and processes is still minor. As a contribution to solve this problem the authors suggest an adaptable and customizable development process for Product-Service Systems. The solution is based on three approaches: (i) a procedure for designing development processes for PSS according to the requirements, (ii) a procedure for individualizing the development process according to specific requirements like e.g. industry, product groups, markets and (iii) the integration of a practical procedure for achieving market-adequate costs in the development process. With this application oriented approach the efficiency of the development process for PSS is increased and the application of methods is promoted.

Abstract: Abstract
This research shows the preliminary results of ongoing research in the understanding of front-end conditions that lever the organization's general disposition toward creating new product-service systems. Semi-structured expert interviews served to build empirical data to exemplify these conditions. We follow a synthesis approach that provides knowledge for manufacturing as well as service providers. We highlight twenty conditions that enable a synergy between products and services when thinking about innovation strategies. More specifically, it aims to ensure both product and service components and their characteristics are continuously discussed in three consecutive front-end of innovation levels; exploration, ideation and definition.

Abstract: Abstract
New forms of solutions with a declined share of mechanics or hardware and instead an increased share of software and (software-enabled) services on the overall customer value proposition, so called cyber-physical systems (CPS), have been emerging for some time now. Current research highlights the underlying technical challenges but lacks a well-founded conceptualization for CPS that reflects its character as a software-enabled hybrid solution, consisting of software as well as of service and tangible product parts. The latter may facilitate research on CPS from a business-oriented and a customer value creation perspective rather than solely from a technical perspective. For this purpose, the present contribution proposes the conceptualization of the industrial software-product-service system. It is based upon empirical findings as well as theoretical considerations on the concept of industrial product-service systems and substantiated by suggested future research directions, derived with the help of the proposed conceptualization.

Abstract: Abstract
The following research work introduces a Cost Engineering Method for Product-Service Systems (PSS) based on a System Cost Uncertainty Analysis (SCUA). The proposed SCUA is a probabilistic method focused on determining the total operational cost of a PSS. The main purpose of this paper is to introduce a PSS cost engineering approach that reduces the aleatory uncertainty that exists in every PSS cost determination, and therefore provides certainty in the cost-capacity relationship that exists in every PSS offering.

Abstract: Abstract
The evolution towards sustainable product service systems introduces a new relationship between product and user in PSS, where we see that the user no longer is the legal owner of the product. This article reports upon an exploration of the psychological relationship between consumer and product within the context of PSS, and addresses the way a shift in ownership influences consumers’ perception. A literature review was needed towards the psychological side of the consumer-product relationship and its relation to different research fields (product attachment, experience design and non-ownership modes of consumption). The result is a set of characteristics that describes the system and the ownership dimensions. This set of characteristics could lead to future research into the correlation of different characteristics, ultimately leading to a set of guidelines for designers designing new PSSs.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) enhance product-centered offers with services and infrastructure in order to provide customer-oriented solutions. These new concepts enable companies to innovate their portfolio, thus supporting creative and adaptable solutions [1]. One of the major challenges is the integrated development of both tangible products and intangible services in respect to their interdependencies. For this reason researchers proposed a versatile set of methods and tools regarding the development of PSS. Nevertheless, two discrepancies can be stated: Firstly, prototyping has been studied inadequately in PSS research so far. For this reason Exner et al. proposed new approaches to fill this gap [2], including remarks to further proceed research with different degrees of technological utilization. Secondly, although customer-orientation and customer integration has been recognized as crucial for PSS, the involvement of clients or consumers in the design process is often disregarded. Consequently, this paper presents an extensive literature research regarding active customer integration and prototyping in PSS design processes. Based on these insights a concept for a new PSS prototyping approach is introduced. The method focuses on PSS concept development including the integration of the customer to evaluate and develop the concepts with intuitive touch technologies.

Abstract: Abstract
With a Product-Service System (PSS), the producer often has control of its products during multiple life-cycles, and thus there are more incentives for design for service and remanufacturing in comparison to traditional sales. The aim of this paper is to explore the role of PSS regarding information feedback transfer in the product life-cycle including remanufacturing. The paper explores two industrial cases where PSS does not yet act as a facilitator for transferring information feedback from remanufacturing to product designers. However, the full potential of PSS is not yet utilized at the companies, and their products are neither designed for PSS nor remanufacturing.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper sets out to contribute to a critical theory debate through the presentation and use of a framework for the categorisation of literature linked to Product Service System (PSS).

Moving from the analysis of literature we provide a conceptual structure depicting the current situation of literature dealing with the analysis of economic impact and environmental/social impact of Product Service System. Moreover, we provide a methodological structure, concerning methodologies and research purpose behind papers.

Literature mainly agrees about PSS benefits, barriers, and partly also on drivers, but from the descriptive and thematic analysis what emerged is a lack of clarity about PSS and its main fields: it started as a topic closely connected with sustainability, but subsequently different fields have developed other terminologies and focuses of research, developing their own theoretical base and frameworks. Therefore, we have found a lack of interconnection among fields and subject areas.

A critical aspect in current literature is about the analysis/evaluation of Product Service System performance: economic and environmental analyses should be updated with new methodologies and new perspectives (i.e. privileging an ex post perspective rather than an ex ante one). Furthermore, these analyses should be integrated in a unique tool, which would be essential in providing a complete perspective on the PSS phenomenon and its effects.

Finally, we propose and discuss main future research directions, connected to the main current research streams: sustainability, Product Service System business models and collaborative consumption.

Abstract: Abstract
In the case of Product-Service Systems (PSS), the design phase is characterized by a demand for intensive exchange of knowledge between stakeholders from different domains. Thus, a comprehensive approach for knowledge sharing would support the integrated development of PSS. Existing attempts are however mainly focusing on using explicit service knowledge for product design and service operations only. Knowledge exchange between domains, including tacit knowledge and sentiment, for the integrated design of products and services have received less attention. The objective of this paper is to present the initial results on the requirements for cross-domain knowledge sharing when designing innovative PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) integrate product and service elements and thus are a basis for better differentiation from the competition, better fulfillment of customer demand and sustainability. Scientific approaches describing PSS often neglect the key resource technology; despite the fact that great potential for innovations can be achieved through disruptive technologies and an extended view on technologies. Extending the view means incorporating services and infrastructure in the technology management of PSS. To meet that research gap, we present a framework describing a layer model for PSS including goals on the upper level, PSS elements at medium level and technologies at the bottom. The layers are connected by means-end relations to highlight the correlations between goals and PSS elements as well as PSS elements and technology.

Abstract: Abstract
The importance of cost engineering within Product-Service Systems (PSS) discipline has increased in recent years. Literature reveals that there is a need for holistic PSS cost determination approaches dealing both with PSS cost engineering and PSS functional uncertainty - as a System of Systems (SoS), as PSS cost determination uncertainty arises from the limited understanding of PSS behavior as a SoS. This work proposes a System Quality Attributes (SQA) Ontology developed to measure the function of a PSS: How well it performs in light of its intended purpose? The PSS-SQA Ontology was constructed on the foundations of SoS Engineering and Reliability Engineering disciplines. It propose a holistic approach to PSS functional measurement, covering the most accepted PSS typology, including product-, use- and result-oriented PSSs. The work contributes to PSS engineering by offering an SQA Ontology that quantifies PSS functionality and reduces PSS functional uncertainty for further cost determination.

Abstract: Companies are striving to create new sources of value, providing integrated product-service solutions to customers, evolving from a “pure product” orientation towards a Product-Service System (PSS) perspective. In this context, Service Engineering (SE), the discipline concerned with the systematic development and design of product-services, is becoming a predominant field. Most of the available Service Engineering models, methods and tools come from traditional engineering, business and computer science approaches adapted to the Service System or Product-Service System. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes a Service Engineering framework that integrates a product-service design modelling tool developed at the Tokyo Metropolitan University with a discrete event simulation test-bench, which enables the comparison of several PSS configurations and the evaluation of both customer and internal performance. A sample case is reported to better clarify the different phases of the framework implementation.

Abstract: Abstract
For modern manufacturing companies, the combination of physical products and intangible services (called Product-Service Systems or PSS) has been proved by time to be useful to enhance the product features by adding value throughout new functionalities, and bringing competitive advantages in a specific target market. Through PSS, companies create new business opportunities, extend the market share, differentiate the product portfolio, and improve sustainability. The PSS approach shifts the company attention from producing physical products to offering integrated systems. However, ideating and designing a PSS is a complex and multifaceted process, which requires multiple competences and cross-functions cooperation within the manufacturing company. In fact, the design phase requires to simultaneous dal with the characteristics of the physical product and of the intangible services, the last ones being by their nature fuzzy and difficult to define. Furthermore, the two entities have to be synergistically delivered and strategically managed thanks to the adoption of a PSS lifecycle management methodology and tools, in particular for the creation of a proper PSS infrastructure to delivery and maintain all the components from the design to the end of life phases. Several methodologies to design PSS can be found in literature. Most of them focus on technical development stages, while some of them face also the innovation aspects and sustainability. However, traditional product-centered approaches are not able to fully support the processes that manufacturing companies have to put in place for creating PSSs. This paper presents a new approach, based on the combination of the Open innovation method with IT solutions supporting information sharing and intra-team cooperation, in that any manufacturing company could adopt to manage the design process of a PSS. In particular, the methodology and the tools are focused on the early stages of the PSS design process, as Ideation and Concept definition that have been developed within the European FP7 project FLEXINET.

Capabilities and resources a potential customer possesses are of utmost importance for suppliers in conceptualizing an industrial product- service system (IPS2). Suppliers have to tailor their offerings to specific situations within purchasing companies and solve underlying problems adequately to achieve customer satisfaction and long-term economic success. Hence, suppliers must identify and analyze customer companies and existing capabilities and resources very precisely to be able to design and conceptualize an individualized IPS2. The paper at hand analyzes the influence of customers’ capabilities and resources, customers’ management style and underlying processes on the choice of a solution.

Abstract: Abstract
As product-service systems are very complex, an integrated approach how to test a service is needed. The paper provides a framework for the development and testing of new services, and thereby grants a lot of space and tools for service innovation. In product-service-systems different types of resources are involved, for instance people, technology, information and organization. In the framework provided by mixed reality laboratory environments, all of these resources are brought together as well. The resources people, technology, information and organization are integrated. The interdisciplinary knowledge concerning these relevant resources is merged in the laboratory environments. Furthermore mixed reality laboratory environments are unifying academic expertise and practical, business-driven interests. Since service relevance in manufacturing companies is growing, the testing of new service concepts gets more important. Various methods are available, which help to verify service concepts. Due to this, the focus of this paper is on the analysis of established Service and Innovation Labs worldwide. To give an overview 24 Service labs are identified and analysed.

Abstract: Abstract
The concept of Product-Service Systems (PSS) allows companies to offer customer focused products by matching classical product concepts with service concepts. This results in new challenges for the development phase. This publication aims to deduce and discuss a generic PSS development process. Therefore product and service development processes were analyzed and combined to a PSS development process. In its development, a PSS confronts the developer with new challenges. Most of these challenges can be assigned to a certain phase in the development, while some of them appear in the entire life-cycle of a PSS. During this research, it was the aim to match the detected challenges of PSS with methods that have been developed for supporting PSS development. The PSS development process, its challenges and methods are finally applied on a PSS case.

Abstract: Abstract
Product manufacturers are extending their responsibilities in the whole life cycle by providing services to their customers. In recent years, product service system has become an important research topic to address the special requirements in the new service driven business model. High value machine tools in modern manufacturing factories are special products: they are regarded as ‘products’ from maintenance point of view, and they also manufacture other products. In the new business model, the quality and behavior of a machine tool not only affect the quality of the parts it manufactures, but also affect the profits of the machine tool’s manufacturer. However, in the research area of product service systems and related computerized maintenance systems, there is a lack of investigation into the special nature, problems and requirements of high value machine tool maintenance, which are very important in modern digitized manufacturing systems. Therefore, this research investigated the various relationships between different stakeholders in the machine tools’ lifecycle, focusing on knowledge management, communication and the decision-making processes. This research also explored the potential application of advanced content management systems, which are widely implemented in the financial, business and government organizations, in the manufacturing engineering domain which has been dominated by traditional engineering information systems. A prototype collaborative maintenance planning system is proposed, developed and evaluated using an example machine tool, which indicated that significant improvement could be achieved and the content management technology has a number of advantages over the traditional engineering information systems, such as computer aided engineering, product data and lifecycle management, and enterprise resource planning systems, in managing machine tool maintenance and service information including dynamic and unstructured knowledge.

Abstract: Abstract
The Product Services Systems philosophy has frequently been put forward as the ultimate form of customer-producer relationship, with mutual benefits in terms of cost, more efficient use of resources, improved performance for the customer, and development of innovative solutions to meeting customer requirements via holistic management of a suite of services for the customer, of which the products form a part. However, it is difficult for enterprises to begin making the shift to PSS without understanding the changes required to their current business models, how these changes may be undertaken in a progressive manner, and the potential benefits that may accrue along the pathway toward PSS. Firstly, this paper establishes a value proposition for PSS, with a set of key principles. These are then examined in terms of the well-established Business Model Canvas. A pathway is then established to assist firms make the shift by taking the necessary steps, and to understand the requirements and potential benefits associated with each step along the way. A case study of an SME is then described to demonstrate these steps in a practical way.

Abstract: Abstract
As for conventional products, the profit generation and the market success of Product Service Systems (PSS) critically depend on the decisions taken during the initial lifecycle stages, when PSSs are conceptualized, designed, developed and engineered. Successful cases show the adoption of lean techniques in the early stages of products development, impelling the authors to assess the application of the same approaches also to PSS development. For this reasons the paper aims to report the state of the art of PSS Design research, relating this strategic process to the Lean Thinking approaches typically applied in traditional Product Development and Manufacturing. The literature about PSS is classified and Lean Thinking evolvement from product manufacturing to design phases is described. On this basis, the paper defines which are the aspects of Lean Thinking already applied in PSS Development also uncovering gaps and lacks of the methods proposed by the scientific literature so far. This opens the way to new opportunities and challenges through many further research and industrial projects.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper describes a process, based on Service Design tools, of product- and service-discovery that has been used in workshops with two Swiss small and medium-sized firms. Both of the firms were manufacturing high-quality products and under pressure on price. The use of individual Design Thinking tools had not provided a route to deliver the product- and service-innovation required; what was missing was a method to combine the individual tools to create a process. The leaders of the firms confirmed that the process described allowed them to expand their thinking from product development to a broader product-service system development process.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) combine tangible products and intangible services in an integrated system which is offered to the customer as an individual solution. Due to interdependencies between these different system elements the complexity of PSS is very high, thus preventing a simple transfer of validation methods of classical product development or service engineering. This leads to a lack of validation methods for the testing of PSS. Within the paper the processes, methods and tools of prototyping are analyzed and possibilities are determined how existing methods can be used for PSS-Prototyping, at which point they can be applied and which aspects of PSS can be validated. Afterwards, a new prototyping approach for PSS is presented in a use case.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) represent a business proposition with potential to provide a wide range of economic, environmental, and social benefits, allowing achievingthe sustainability. However, PSS does not necessarily lead to sustainable solutions and this potential must be assessed in each case. In this sense, the aim of this paper is to investigate sustainable aspects of a ‘result oriented PSS’(a reverse osmosis water filter system) available in Brazil and compares it with the conventional product, the bottled water. Some aspects from the literature, mentioned as important in each sustainability dimension, were selected to analyze the PSS under study. A qualitative analysis was performed and demonstrates that in comparison with bottled water, the water filter PSS is competitive, satisfy customer needs, and has a relatively lower environmental impact. However, besides conceiving sustainable solutions, is necessary to identify which factors drive the implementation and diffusion of PSS. Some findings of this study suggest that the effects caused by unexpected consumer behavior and incorrect PSS application may compromise PSS sustainable performance during operational phase. An analysis of these effects during transition process is essential to successful sustainable strategies. The study aimed to contribute to the PSS empirical knowledge and to assist building a theoretical basis regarding PSS and sustainability.

Abstract: Abstract
The transition from a product–oriented business towards a PSS-oriented business, known in the scientific literature as ‘servitization’ involves complex changes for decision-makers. Over the past years, the scientific literature has provided consistent advances in PSS decision-support systems including PSS modelling. However, concerning PSS modelling languages or formalisms, most initiatives remain context dependent; to date only a small a piece of literature addresses the need for reproducibility of PSS modelling methods. The objective of this paper is to make a first step forward in this direction, by proposing an iterative procedure dedicated to build generic meta-models and by applying it to generate a first proposal of PSS meta-model, expected to be re-usable in several distinct modelling and decision-making contexts.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper aims at exploring how some factors identified in the PSS and product/service innovation literature can hinder or foster sustainable PSS implementation in developing countries, since there is a lack of knowledge concerning the characteristics of PSS transition processes in different contexts. The identified factors were investigated empirically, through two PSS solutions located in an emerging economy. The main results demonstrated the role of some potential factors in supporting the implementation and diffusion of PSS solutions, especially those related to the involvement of multiple actors in the value creation and the social embeddedness. However, the role of those factors still need to be investigated in future works, since only two cases were analyzed in this research. Analyses of successful and unsuccessful PSS cases as well as the identification of other factors and characteristics of PSS implementation in different contexts are directions for further research.

Abstract: Abstracts
Research suggests that product service systems (PSS) may usefully form part of the mix of innovations necessary to move society toward more sustainable futures. However, PSS implementation rates are disappointingly low and an implementation gap has emerged. Drawing on consumer culture theory (CCT), this paper provides insights to help resolve this issue in business to consumer markets. Since consumption of use orientated PSS is analogous to access based consumption, six dimensions of access are set out to analyse a case study of infant car seat provision. Five outcomes are derived from the analysis and these include partial identification with accessed product and interplay of use and symbolic value. This analysis questions the view that PSS do not create sufficient value to overcome a preference for ownership in western societies. Rather, PSS consumption is likely to arise when both functional and symbolic value are extracted by consumers and when PSS are promoted to appropriate consumer groups such as ‘nomads’. Further research is needed to explore these phenomena and address the issues they raise in PSS design processes.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite the growing research interest in PSS design and development methods in recent years, there is still no fully stabilized and shared understanding of the PSS design process. This can be partly explained by two main gaps: the decoupled design of product and services and the lack of operational solutions. This research aims at outlining the main characteristics of a proposal for a new PSS design framework, expected to contribute answering these 2 gaps. The proposition is based jointly on a recently created PSS design methodology and an extension of the functional analysis (FA) approach (NF X 50-100), which is commonly used in product design. The proposed framework intends to smoothly integrate the whole PSS design process, including product-service design and the network configuration.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays, PSS lifecycle models are a crucial issue. The management of both the product and the service lifecycle together is recent: to date, there is no evidence of an accepted and operational combined lifecycle model. Furthermore, PSS lifecycle models are based on top-down approach, which are not always suitable from an engineering point of view. The aim of this paper is to propose a reference procedure, built on a bottom-up methodology, for the designing and modeling of PSSs and its lifecycles, applied to the automotive sector.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies are increasingly selling functionalities of integrated solutions of products and services instead of selling mere products. This integration of products and service solutions is known as Product Service Systems (PSS), which allows to maximize customer value and overcome increasing competition in the manufacturing sector. In this sense, PSS designers require adapted tools to support the design of sustainable solutions. This article aims to address this question by proposing a methodological framework for integrating sustainability considerations into the PSS design process. To this end a review of the peculiarities of the PSS design process was performed and which aims to explore potential ways of integrating sustainability considerations within PSS design. Several requirements have been drawn from PSS design and sustainability literature which contributed towards the formalization of a methodological framework supporting the design of sustainable PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-service system (PSS) or particularly industrial product-service system (IPS2) is started to gain more attention as innovative strategy to face the competitive global market. Service aspect from IPS2 offering is believed could provide more values for customer than the standalone physical product. This new concept is not fully developed yet. There are some particular areas around IPS2 concept which are needed to be more explored and one of them is the cost dimension aspect. Cost is obviously important for company as basic information to support decision making process. Traditional costing system is no longer able to facilitate the company's transformation. The following work will present the analysis of current costing systems and a new assessment framework proposed to address the needs of IPS2 environment, particularly for IPS2 function-oriented business model. The proposed framework is developed based on the literature findings. Considering the specific characteristics of IPS2 business model, lean accounting is the best choice from current costing systems to be adjusted into the proposed framework. Lean accounting with its value stream costing (VSC) is able to provide comprehensive cost information to support company's long transformation journey towards a fully and successful IPS2 company.

Abstract: Abstract
In September 2015, the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the Sustainable Development Goals; they include SDG 7 targeting universal access to electricity by 2030. Reaching this goal implies huge investments in generation capacity, grid extension and densification. However, according to the International Energy Agency, 70% of the world's population currently excluded from electricity services can only be reached by decentralized solutions such as Mini Grids and Solar Home Systems.

The use of Solar Home Systems (SHS) has shown mixed results in the last decades. In literature, ‘quality’ is often mentioned as an important success factor. However, the term ‘quality’ often stays undefined and actors have various understandings of it. The authors propose a framework for the definition of the quality of SHS with a focus on the economic benefit of the end-users and based on the concept of Product-Service Systems. In this approach, products and services are equal parameters. This enables a flexible design and dimensioning of SHS without implying a fixed set of international quality standards. Doing so, the PSS Quality Framework for SHS avoids creating preferences for products from industrialized nations and underlines the enormous potential of local manufacturing and services in developing countries, particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite their substantial potential for enabling increased environmental performance, product/service-systems (PSS) are not intrinsically environmentally sustainable. In order to ensure increased environmental performance, PSS best practices should be integrated with ecodesign best practices, from the early stages of the development process. This paper aims to identify the best practices for PSS development, based on a systematic literature review, and to propose their integration into an existing maturity model for ecodesign, the EcoM2, into which 30 best practices for PSS development are identified and integrated. The proposed approach has the potential to enable the development of environmentally sustainable PSS offerings.

The product-service systems (PSS) literature has demonstrated the need to understand how consumption patterns influence PSS introduction. This study investigates a result-oriented PSS for drinking water provision from the social practice theory perspective to provide insights of how approaches focused on the consumption side may be valuable for PSS development. A conceptual framework based on the literature was built to guide the study. For gathering field data, observations and semi-structured interviews were carried out. The main results demonstrated that the analysis of the practices elements, its configurations and the way practices interlock with one another are valuable for PSS design.

Abstract: Abstract
Recently, product-service systems (PSSs) have begun attracting attention as income-generation options for manufacturers. While many researchers have developed design methods and evaluation tools for PSSs and have validated their effectiveness, guidelines for how to use these methods and tools in the design process are rare. As a first step for developing guidelines for PSS design, this paper reviews the existing design methods and evaluation tools for PSS outlined in the Proceedings of the CIRP International Conference on Industrial Product-Service Systems, 2009–2013.

Abstract: Abstract
Given the offer of products, which are losing their competitive value, companies begin to seek solutions to improve their market position through the inclusion of services. The development of product-service systems (PSS) is a solution that has been discussed by the academia in recent years, resulting in an increasing number of publications. The literature not only shows a growing interest in PSS but also points out some research gaps such as the lack of characterization of a PSS and the difficulty of identifying a PSS. In this sense, this paper proposes an application of a framework that characterizes a PSS in a real situation. The aim is to check if the real situation presents the characteristics of a PSS highlighted by the framework. The framework presents conceptual elements throughout the life cycle of a PSS: Requirements definition of a PSS; Development of a PSS; Implementation of a PSS; Monitoring a PSS; and Post-use disposal of a PSS. These elements are intended to identify the characteristics of PSS for each stage of the cycle. The real situation identified in the existing literature on PSS presents basic characteristics of a PSS, it contains its four main factors: product, service, actors network and infrastructure and presents the similarity of the three types of PSS (product-oriented, use-oriented and results-oriented). Thus, the framework is applied in the practical case to identify characteristics of PSS. This application is carried from a questionnaire based on conceptual elements arranged in stages of the life cycle of the PSS. The responses were analyzed highlighting main conceptual elements characteristics. With the information obtained from the questionnaire, the results demonstrate the company's current situation and the PSS characteristics that could be implemented.

Abstract: Abstract
To date, majority of current studies of product service system are approached from manufacturer’ perspectives, while relatively few efforts have been devoted to investigate customer's decision making in between product and service. According to the Prospect Theory, there exist a variety of factors that will lead people to make irrational decisions. That being said, a clear understanding of the reason why and under what conditions people tend to behave irrationally is useful in improving existing services and designing new services. This paper presents some preliminary discussions of applicability of the Prospect Theory on a use-oriented product service system - car sharing service.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to the shift from products to services and the resulting gain of importance in planning product-service systems (PSS), a reliable decision process for the planning phase of PSS is essential. In this paper, we defined requirements for such a decision process by analyzing several decision processes for early stages of product and service development from literature. Interpreting their advantages and disadvantages reveals that none of the approaches fulfills all requirements needed for planning PSS. For this reason, we built a decision process by combining and extending elements of existing decision processes. The result is a process model, which facilitates to adapt requirements and characteristics several times. Unlike other approaches from literature, this process provides a higher customer integration, adaptable requirements list and it considers services, tangible products and PSS-infrastructure. To identify weaknesses and strengths of our decision process, we conducted a small case study. For this, a student team used this process for planning a rentable pedelec for tourists and commuters.

Abstract: Abstract
In manufacturing, product-service systems (PSS) that create value by coupling a physical product and a service have been attracting attention. In PSS, it is important for providers to enhance the value-in-use that is perceived by customers in utilizing a product and/or service. Customers play a key role in realizing such value and therefore, are regarded as co-producers in the value-creation process. Although customer involvement plays an essential role in realizing value, previous research has revealed its risks. Therefore, PSS providers are required to adopt a suitable strategy for involving customers. However, current studies do not necessarily offer much guidance on determining such strategies. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a framework that analyzes the benefits and risks of customer involvement in PSS development. This framework aims to identify factors that influence benefits and risks from the viewpoints of characteristics of a PSS and its customer involvement. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is validated through a case study.

Abstract: Abstract
Research in the area of the integrated development of products and services, designated as Product-Service Systems (PSS), is maturing and a transition in industrial practices is noticeable. Nevertheless, PSS development methodologies lack consistent approaches regarding the integrated validation of different PSS elements rather than a separate development and validation. To prevent an expensive roll-out and testing in late development stages new methodologies and techniques need to be developed and applied. The challenge is theenablement of experiencing and thus testing of PSS in early stages, like planning and concept phase.In order to address these challenges for an integrated validation of PSS a prototyping approach named SHP4PSS has been introduced on a conceptual level [1], integrating virtual and physical prototypes in a Virtual Reality (VR). To complete the methodology a matrix is presented to derive test cases out of early PSS concepts.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturers of capital goods are subject to high requirements regarding availability and productivity. Services give manufacturers the opportunity to expand technical products and to fulfill all customer requirements. Solution concepts that consist of a union of technical products and services are called Product-Service Systems (PSS). For the realization of PSS, the capital goods manufacturer (PSS-provider) must collaborate with each participant of his extended value-added network. The extended value-added network consists of members of the development, production and service. This cooperation and complete interconnection with each participant provides the foundation of the development and offer of availability-oriented business models. This paper presents an approach for PSS which enables innovative services for the extended value-added network and for the customers in order to realize customized, availability-oriented business models. The approach is based on three sub-goals. First, development of PSS and customized, availability-oriented business models. This goal is presented in the paper. Second, development of smart components for collecting and processing of service relevant data. Third, design and configuration of an information management platform to provide and exchange service relevant data.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies experience an increasing importance for implementing sustainability concerns into their processes and product offerings. In the consumer electronics industry, traditional manufacturing-focused initiatives to minimize the environmental impacts of products are currently still far from satisfactory. The European research project SMC-Excel aims atenhancing the ecological sustainability in the consumer electronics industry through the integration of new business models based on the ideas and concepts of mass customization. In this paper, first insights of the project revealed during a Business Model Innovation workshop are presented. The main hypothesis derived in this workshop – the suitability of product service systems as a lever for the sustainability potential of mass customization– is discussed with the help of an analysis of the state-of-the-art literature on product service systems and mass customization. The paper concludes that the combination of mass customization patterns and product service system patterns carries a significant potential to foster the environmental sustainability of the full business model, but that this potential is highly context dependent. The insights of this paper set up the basis for further empiric research in the consumer electronics industry.

Abstract: Abstract
In the last decades, companies have shifted from traditional business models based on selling products to product-service systems (PSS). Despite this tendency, there is a paucity of complete methodologies and tools to guide companies on how the transition should occur. To address this issue, the goal of this research is to present a complete framework to support manufacturing companies in the servitization journey. This novel proposal involves the application of design thinking to define the value proposition integrated with a PSS oriented business model creation, that goes beyond generic methods normally applied; and the specification of business process architecture to support PSS implementation. This research followed a prescriptive approach by means of action research technique. Key findings of the framework application are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
Product Service Systems (PSS) focus on the delivery of value to the customer and their continuous satisfaction. This overarching goal has to be reflected during the design and development of PSS. With the changing business models of PSS, away from a one-time sale towards a constant delivery of customer satisfaction and value, the whole lifecycle of a PSS is becoming increasingly important. A similar development can also be observed for ‘traditional’ products and services. However, for PSS this holistic emphasis can be considered a key factor for success. The changing requirements and needs brought forth by PSS and their impact on the ‘traditional’ PLM models are discussed in this paper. An emphasis is on the three-phase model and its presentation, which is often used to illustrate the product lifecycle from a technical and IT perspective. Finally, some adaptations for the traditional illustration are presented as a first starting point for further discussion and in-depth research within the community.

Abstract: Abstract
More and more companies are beginning to move beyond manufacturing as a sole source of profit by offering integrated bundles of physical goods and services. This phenomenon has become popularly known as servitization, or the establishment of product–service systems (PSSs). Additionally, since the success of the Japanese after WWII and the subsequent popularization of the term “Lean Production” in the 1990s, lean too has almost become a nirvana for the majority of producers. Lean has also found its way into service operations, yet there is an apparent lack of knowledge when it comes to combining the successes associated with lean thinking with the potential of PSSs. Therefore, in this paper, we make use of two best-in-class lean companies that are recognized for excellence in both product and service offerings in order to analyse PSS operations in light of lean thinking. As such, we adopt a multiple case study approach in order to propose a framework for lean product-oriented product–service systems.

Abstract: Abstract
The paper addresses the Functional Products business model and how its elements are mapped to Hill categories in five industrial cases. The Hill categories include: order-winners, order-losers and qualifiers. The objective for Functional Products is to provide a function to customers with an agreed-upon level of availability, productivity or efficiency, etc. The paper outlines how different cases and their offers, based upon the Functional Products business model, can be element-wise mapped to Hill categories. Insight into the importance of the different business model elements provides valuable knowledge for an appropriate planning, design, sales and provision of Functional Products, as well as for determining how much effort, resources and money to spend on keeping the status of the element sharp, up-to-date, acceptable or just present.

Abstract: Abstract
Many manufacturers today are striving to offer high value-added product-service systems (PSS) to their customers. Since the success of the PSS largely depends on the understanding and satisfying of different requirements, requirements management (RM) has become a critical factor in PSS development. However, PSS are mixed product-service offerings with features of heterogeneity, interaction, stakeholder participation and customization, which makes the PSS requirement difficult to be captured, analyzed, concretized and forecasted. Thus, this research analyzes the state of the art of requirements management for PSS by reviewing extensive literature of requirement identification, analysis, specification, and forecast. Based on the review, key challenges and future research directions are identified, and they are requirement elicitation considering interactions, hybrid PSS conflict detection and resolution, dynamic requirement forecasting with big data, smart requirement management and proactive response. This literature review lays the foundation for future research of PSS development.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper's objective is to analyze, based on a literature review, how existing IPSO design methods support and manage requirements when developing an IPSO. Issues analyzed are e.g. which types of aspects existing methods should consider, such as environmental issues and demands from stakeholders and customers. Another issue is what types of stakeholders are involved in the process. There is also an interest in finding out which of these methods are used in the industry. The goal is that the results will provide insight into how the requirements specification is used when developing an IPSO in theory, and in what way this insight will contribute to future studies on how companies currently derive and manage requirements when developing an IPSO.

The literature review started out with the analysis of 201 papers, yielding 22 papers within the area of working with requirements for an IPSO. These papers were reviewed and summarized with the above issues and interests in mind. Findings are that when deriving requirements, existing IPSO design methods are lacking in regard to a holistic life cycle and system perspective of the offering. Few of the methods consider both requirements regarding the environmental impact of the offering and demands from all involved stakeholders, normally only the customer. Furthermore, few studies have ended with a clear work process regarding how to initially find the requirements to analyze them and later interpret them as actual metrics. There are also no signs that existing methodology is used in the industry's day-to-day work.

Abstract: Abstract
The range and intention of Product-Service System (PSS) design are quite different from the traditional product-oriented design. Therefore, designers and design organizations in the future must have new capabilities and competencies to realize an effective PSS design. In this study, the authors develop an educational business game for accustoming users to the philosophy of PSS and changing their mindset. Business games have the advantage of effective and enjoyable learning through strategic thinking in a simulated business environment. This paper presents the latest structure of the developed game and types of strategic thinking of players in the game. The effectiveness of this game is demonstrated by the application in several workshops.

Abstract: Abstract
There are more and more applications of Product Service Systems (PSS) in today's industry in both B2B and B2C sectors. PSS is able to bring plenty of benefits to the customer, the provider, the environment and the society. In order to unleash the full potential of PSS in terms of industrial adoption, there is a need for the improvement of (i) customer's perception of its value, (ii) pre-launch evaluation, and (iii) design quality. None of the existing methodologies and tools provides a comprehensive approach for all of those three aspects.

In this paper, the authors propose a strategic framework for PSS prototyping. The proposed framework can support the customer's perception of value, the evaluation of PSS design before actual implementation and the improvement of design quality. An illustrating example of implementation of the proposed framework is also included for demonstration purpose.

Abstract: Abstract
A transition from a product-selling to a Product-Service Systems (PSS) business model incurs a transition in costs from customer to provider. Due to this shift in cost ownership, Life Cycle Costing (LCC) is used by providers and customers to better understand the PSS costs spanning from design to end-of-life. Through a literature review the paper determines that there are similarities in the approach to LCC for specific types of PSS e.g. availability type, but further research needs to be undertaken to identify commonalities between different types of PSS.

The review also discerned that the terminology for LCC is not consistent and sometimes it is used to identify only the costs incurred by a specific actor. Furthermore, the end-of-life stage and the implications of a second life for a remanufactured PSS in LCC are also yet to be fully understood. A number of challenges associated with obtaining quality data for costing within PSS were identified. These include the lack of availability, the relevancy due to use of pre-PSS data that does not reflect the redesign of products and services to fit in PSS and challenges associated with the design paradox. Finally, a lack of empirical studies is noted.

Abstract: Abstract
Product–Service System (PSS) business models let firms sell the functionality of a physical product rather than the product itself, typically while retaining ownership and control of the product. PSS business models can increase the sustainability of product industries as the life-cycle responsibility of PSS firms incentivize the creation of more durable products, facilitate effective repair and maintenance regimes, and make obsolescence plans for products important.

Extant PSS research is predominantly concerned with how manufacturing firms add PSS offerings to their existing operation, a process that often is difficult. This article argues that a key source for PSS growth may be intermediary firms, purpose-built for the business model to constitute a link between manufacturers and customers. The topic has been touched upon indirectly by scholars but not dealt with by PSS literature as a phenomenon in its own right. Yet intermediary PSS actors are already reshaping technology sectors. The solar panel market in the US, today dominated by the business model, is a prominent example. Firms with intermediary PSS business models are also advancing in areas such as local heating solutions and electric vehicle sharing.

So how do intermediary PSS firms emerge? Based on comprehensive case studies of intermediary firms in the solar industry and other sectors, this article presents central insights on how intermediary PSS ventures are built and what role they can play. The study focuses on the types of alliances and alliance formation processes needed by intermediary ventures while also suggesting hypotheses on the sustainability impact of the business model. In addition to theoretical contributions the article provides advice to manufacturers aiming to benefit from the growth of intermediary PSS business models.

Abstract: Abstract
The product service system offers opportunities for companies by introducing new ways of offering value to the customer. Thus, the value proposition needs to take into account uncertainties and tangible and intangible assets in an integrated way leading to more complex decisions. To address these decisions, the study proposes the application of scenarios with real options considering the most suitable financial performance indicators. This research followed the design research methodology. As a result, the proposal considers three scenarios: optimistic, moderate and pessimistic, each showing three possible real options: to expand, to abandon and to defer the incorporation of the service.

Abstract: Abstract
The concept of product-service systems (PSS) combines classical products with additional services. Consequences are, e.g. due to a strong customer integration, various challenges with dynamic, behavioral and uncertainty aspects. This publication clarifies the importance of these aspects by a literature review. Existing approaches to model and cope with dynamic are revealed and assigned to a structural PSS model. This model is based on an e-bike sharing system and highlights important domains for PSS development. Different starting points for dynamic modeling are discussed in the PSS model to support PSS developers in the selection of a sufficient dynamic model.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies searching for new ways to be competitive in dynamic markets are integrating product and service to better fulfill customer demands and improve sales. A well designed and efficiently developed Product-Service System (PSS) is a solid alternative to achieve this goal. The PSS design should search for new ways to add value for both company and customers. The PSS design model may help the company to innovate, strengthen competitiveness and assure the desired profit. In this paper we propose a methodology that integrates Design Thinking (DT) and Business Analytics (BA) in the PSS design in a way to build a profitable and lasting PSS. Design Thinking is a human-centered and systematic approach to problem solving and is used in the model to deeply understand customer needs and satisfy their emotional requirements considering company's resources and constraints. BA is the capacity to aggregate, to analyze and to use data in a way to optimize the business results. The large quantity of information available from sensors, logs and other machine sources, associated with information and communication technologies (ICT) advances allow companies to collect and analyze a large quantity of data. Through the data analysis, companies may evaluate consumer behavior, sense changes in the market quickly and identify new opportunities to innovate. Furthermore, companies may use the data as a third layer to add value besides the product and service layers. The proposed model addresses a lack in the literature of PSS design and adds relevant information for companies designing or reconfiguring a PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
In the delivery of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2), a dynamic network of partners is involved. To deliver and use IPS2 efficiently, the IPS2 has to be managed from several heterogeneous perspectives, namely from a strategic, inter-organizational, operational and information perspective. To manage the information exchange between the partners, an architecture that supports the interaction between the perspectives and their corresponding software systems is needed. This paper introduces the different management perspectives of IPS2 and their interplay. For the information exchange, an architectural approach is presented and implemented within a conceptual scenario situated in the micro milling industry. Especially the web service-based interaction between an IPS2-Lifecycle Management System (IPS2-LMS) and an IPS2- Execution System (IPS2-ES) is described in detail.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays manufacturing companies, that traditionally sell stand-alone products or services, shift towards selling industrial product service systems (IPS2). These offerings are mainly discussed as a chance for both; suppliers as well as customers. Customers profit for example by gaining access to expert knowledge or by outsourcing operations. Nevertheless, customers’ actual responses towards IPS2 offerings have not been subject to research yet. By empirically analyzing reasons why customers step back from buying IPS2 this paper contributes to existing knowledge. Results show that customers perceive higher risk when buying IPS2, feel more dependent on the IPS2 supplier and fear to loose know-how.

Abstract: Abstract
To develop a business model oriented to sustainability, sustainability aspects should already be taken into account at the planning stages, when strategies, ideas, opportunities and concepts are identified and created. However, there is a lack of methods to assist the creation of sustainable business models. To cope with this challenge, a method named Configurator of product-service system (PSS) proposals was developed in order to support companies to create business models for selling functionality instead of product property. Through the application of this method together with the scenario planning technique, a product concept was transformed into a product-service system business model. For this purpose, the multifunctional team responsible for the creation of this concept utilized the method to develop a business model for Pedelec (pedal electric cycle) inserted in a sharing system and taking into account the future development of the city of Berlin.

Abstract: Abstract
Reports about the depletion and pollutant of the earth by human interference and the increasing need for urbanised areas require us to think differently about how we go about achieving this increased urbanisation. In this context, urban mining, where demolition sites are mined for increased recycling and value extraction. Due to high specialisation of construction equipment for this context, as well as sustainability being an important factor, product-service systems are suggested as a way forward in this area. This paper presents key topics that needs to be addressed when developing sustainable product-service systems for the urban mining segment. The idea is to transform from a traditional construction and demolition perspective towards a PSS-based construction product for an urban mining environment, incorporating a circular economy perspective. A modification to the common business model notation of business model canvas, with guiding questions is suggested. Opportunities for improved sustainability lies both in application – within an urban mining site – and in the enabling technology – when technology is specialised, owned by the provider, and utilised by multiple partners.

Abstract: Abstract
A fundamental change in how businesses are conducted and operated is an essential factor to reach more sustainable solutions not only on the industry level but also for the entire society. In this sense, the importance of developing and implementing sustainable product service system (S-PSS) business models is increasing as the number of studies are presenting it. A S-PSS business model is an approach to achieve benefits in the three dimensions of sustainability. Through efficient resource utilization and dematerialization, this type of sustainable business model helps to embed environmental and social aspects into strategic business goals and processes while increases competitive advantage. However, most of the studies that treats PSS business models do not mention their relation to sustainability. In addition, different studies take for granted that implementing PSS leads to benefits in the three sustainability dimensions. Nonetheless, PSS business models can even have a negative effect on the environment while maintaining only economic benefits. Such contradictions and incoherencies hinder the potential of PSS business models to provide sustainability benefits and might be a barrier for its adoption. Therefore, the question this study pursues is: What are the factors that make a PSS a sustainable business model? Through literature analysis, this paper proposes the identification of a set of factors that contributes to the sustainability of PSS business models. The factors identified are investigated in an exemplary case of a bike sharing system.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) has been regarded as an attractive business concept that create high added value by integrated provisions of products and services.Since both products and services are included in the design object, the PSS design process has become increasingly complicated. Thus, the designers need to organize reliably what they should accomplish during the PSS design process. However, it is difficult for designers to grapple what they need to focus on during PSS design process. To support such PSS design process, this paper proposes a PSS design guideline which based on Software Engineering Methods and Theory (SEMAT).

Abstract: Abstract
In existing literature concerning integrated product-service (IPS) offers within manufacturing industry there are various closely related business concepts covering the shift from offering only physical artifacts (e.g. material goods, hardware) towards provision of integrated products and services, as well as further advanced offers. It has been observed that manufacturing companies offering, for instance, Product-Service Systems (PSS) face certain challenges during the development process. Further, research regarding Functional Products (FP) has developed ideas and methods that are also applicable to the PSS development process. FP and PSS are, depending on the level of complexity, often developed and later operated by regional or global provider consortiums. This paper, based on a literature review, highlights unsolved challenges in the development of PSS offerings and further proposes how ideas and methods from FP development (FPD) may resolve some of those challenges. Thus, ideas from FPD may advance the development of PSS, as well as other IPS offerings, towards being additionally robust and innovative, though also more complex.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper focuses on the evaluation of the environmental impacts of a PSS based on the Life Cycle Assessment methodology. Since current LCA tools are mainly product-oriented, solutions that allow an easy integration of the service component are needed. A reference architecture guiding the execution of the LCI phase is proposed both considering how service and product information jointly contribute to data gathering in the lifecycle phases and providing a more detailed checklist of information categories. The proposed architecture in this version has been thought to be as general as possible in order to be applied to any type of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Aspects of customer acceptance describe reasons and issues that are relevant for customer decisions for or against purchasing a product. In previous works, we have built a model of those aspects that serves as a checklist for identifying relevant aspects. Furthermore, we have built a customer-oriented framework for planning and developing of Product-Service Systems (PSS). This framework models relations between customers, aspects of customer acceptance, and the PSS. PSS is considered as an approach to better meet customer requirements and to improve customer benefits from using a product. By adding services and integrating tangible product contents and intangible service contents to one market offer, PSS can be advantageous for the aspects of customer acceptance. The customer-oriented framework makes a PSS concept to focus on aspects of customer acceptance. In this work, we adapted and applied this framework for a case study in construction machine industries. This case study aimed on evaluating methods, models, and processes we built in previous work for increasing customer acceptance and to identify strengths, weaknesses, and potential for optimization of those methods, models, and processes.

Abstract: Abstract
While the provision of industrial product-service systems (IPS2) is considered to be traditional manufacturers’ way out of stagnant markets, research has so far neglected potential negative outcomes of IPS2 provision. The authors derive propositions about inherent characteristics of IPS2 provision that increase customers’ perceived risk – customers’ need uncertainty, challenges of evaluating IPS2 performance, change processes triggered by IPS2 implementations and entering long term relationships. Further, consequences of customers’ risk perception are presented. Understanding sources and consequences of customers’ high risk perception enables researchers and practitioners to develop relevant risk reduction strategies and argument purchase probabilities.

Abstract: Abstract
The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) approach faces new challenges if transferred for Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2). The vast amount of heterogeneous data generated throughout an IPS2's lifecycle complicates the retrieval of required information for IPS2 actors. However, these actors’ risky decisions determine an IPS2's success during use phase. Thus, an approach is needed that supports actors in finding targeted information. This paper presents a framework that utilizes semantic and text mining techniques in order to improve the information retrieval process in IPS2-PLM and to allow IPS2 actors to focus on their value-adding tasks rather than spending a lot of time for finding information.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite their substantial potential for enabling increased environmental performance, product/service-systems (PSS) are not intrinsically environmentally sustainable. In order to ensure increased sustainability performance, PSSand related business models needs to be developed taking into account best practice for ecodesign implementation and management. The Ecodesign Maturity Model (EcoM2) is a management framework that supports manufacturing companies to consistently and systematicallyimplement ecodesign, based on a step-by-step approach. EcoM2 contains a database containing more than 600 practices, categorized into management practices, operational practices and methods &amp;tools. Currently, only two management practices of theEcoM2address PSS development. This paper aims to identify the best practices for PSS development, based on a literature review, followed by a presentation of a proposal for the integration of the new practices for PSS development into the EcoM2. In total, 17 best practices for PSS development were identified in this research, and integrated into the EcoM2. The proposed EcoM2 for PSS model has the potential to support the development of environmentally sustainable PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
The growing importance of different kind of services in urban and wider contexts highlights the need for integrated, designed and managed service systems. A methodological framework based on Product Service System, can aid in better understanding and organizing services, supporting the identification of strategic urban actions, and prescribing system design choices that respond to citizen needs. This approach can be strategic if applied to the management of services and products in the high complexity of a city, characterized by coping with different layers of digital data and integrated flows of people, economic and social information. This research aims to investigate and classify the literature on PSS for identifying applications of products and services for different scale of territorial planning. A PSS-based methodology is proposed that allows to respond to the complex need of the territorial and urban planning process and to guide stakeholders toward shared and transparent decision-making. The paper is a useful reference for policy makers and academics that want to have a clear and critical understanding of the use of PSS in urbanism and territorial governance.

Abstract: Abstract
The well-established Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) concept can support the development or assessment of Product-Service Systems (PSS), since it adopts a lifecycle perspective, therefore enabling a “whole cost” evaluation, that may lead to eco-efficient choices by customers. This paper explores an application of the TCO concept to aluminum melting furnaces, a specific example of highly energy-intensive equipment.

A TCO model is created, validated and tested through 8 case studies of small- and medium-sized aluminum die casting producers located in Lombardy. Empirical findings of the analyses carried out through the model suggest the main determinants of furnaces TCO and possible levers to reduce costs of such equipment. On average, operating costs of an aluminum melting furnace, such as materials, labor and energy, combine for about 95% of the furnace TCO. Based on current operational modalities, the studied companies incur costs ranging from about 127 to 400 Euros per ton of molten aluminum, due to furnaces ownership and utilization. This evaluation leads to identify actions to reduce such costs (e.g. through energy-efficient furnaces, scale economies by installing centralized, large-sized furnaces) and ideas for the development of use or result-oriented PSS types.

Abstract: Abstract
In recent years, European manufacturing companies are gradually applying innovative PSS (Product Service Systems), as strategic opportunity for differentiating from competitors, offering an integrated bundle of products and services, targeted on specific needs of different customers. At the same time, frugal innovation has also surged as a new business concept based upon an intelligent use of resources to fulfill region-dependent customers’ needs. Both approaches bring forth rethinking of established business models, which in turn asks for an in-depth analysis of the implications on the company organization and infrastructure, at supply chain and plant levels, urging towards manufacturing networks and reconfigurable assembly lines. This paper presents a formalized framework to support product-service design and the related business model characterization, in the context of frugal innovation. The methodology is applied to three real industrial scenarios respectively in the aeronautics, the domestic appliances and the machinery industry, which are analyzed within the framework of the H2020 European funded project ‘ProRegio’.

Abstract: Abstract
Although Product-Service Systems (PSS) are recognized as a promising model in literature, they are still not widely implemented in companies, mainly due to cultural barriers. Education should play a major role in removing these barriers and fostering the diffusion and implementation of PSS. This paper focuses on engineering education for graduate students and presents an original training program that was built and implemented at the Ecole des Mines de Saint-Etienne (EMSE). The main characteristics of this program are (i) multidisciplinarity, in terms of mixing PSS engineering and managerial approaches, and (ii) mixing theory, case studies and the use of simulation, based on several educational tools. The program is assessed out of the gathering of students’ perceptions, which contributed to elaborate on some requirements regarding teaching servitization and PSS based on experiential learning theory.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSS) as an integration of product and service elements in one market offer promise amongst others better fulfillment of customer demand, quicker innovation, differentiation from competitors and sustainability. However in the industrial practice there are major challenges in successfully offering these PSS. One of these challenges is to gain market acceptance for PSS. Whereas benefits for providers and customers have been widely discussed in literature, going beyond these statements and analyzing factors on the market acceptance of PSS is hardly discussed. The paper gives the theoretical foundations for a model explaining an integrated set of factors for and against the market acceptance of PSS in B2B environments.

Abstract: Abstract
A stand-alone technical product in many cases is not sufficient to fulfill customers’ requirements. Machine tool manufacturers have already reacted to this fact by offering combinations of products and services, commonly known as technical Product-Service Systems (PSS). Today, nearly every machine tool manufacturer offers PSS. In order to stay competitive, quality leadership of PSS is a promising competitive strategy for machine tool manufacturers. Thus, it is necessary to develop a PSS specific quality management. However, key performance indicators and criteria for assessing the quality of PSS in the machine tool industry are currently missing.

The aim of this paper is to present a customer-oriented approach for assessing the quality of PSS in the machine tool industry. This serves to ensure and continuously improve a long-term business relationship between a PSS provider and its customers. Use cases from the machine tool industry build the basis for this paper. To begin with, existing quality criteria of products and services in the machine tool industry are analyzed. These criteria are gathered by interviews with machine tool manufacturers, customer surveys and literature research. Next, interdependencies between product and service quality are identified. Then PSS-specific quality criteria are developed, which consider product and service quality criteria as well as their interdependencies. Finally, key performance indicators are presented in order to assess and benchmark the quality of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Many manufacturers today are striving to offer high value-added Product/Service System (PSS) due to increasing competition and environmental pressure. PSS design activities face a variety of challenges such as a high level of customization as well as its resulting challenges, i.e., hidden requirements in product use phase, potential conflicts of design attributes, and internal complexity of service processes. However, existing insights for PSS customization are fragmented and insufficient to support manufacturers. Thus, it is necessary to develop a systematic and comprehensive support to solve those issues. In order to support PSS customization in early design phase, this paper proposes a design framework that involves a design process. The proposed design framework is module-based and thus flexible according to the user needs. In addition, it takes advantage of some existing methods. A case study of elevator PSS design shows the feasibility and potentials of the design framework and its associated design process to its broad usage in industry.

Abstract: Abstract
Remanufacturing represents a well-suited approach for sustainable development in environmental, economic and social dimensions. Product-service systems (PSS) are among the most important enabler for remanufacturing. Companies that remain owner of a product have an intrinsic motivation to design goods for longer lifecycles considering the possibility of remanufacturing the product or its parts after each use phase. In addition, as the end customer only uses the goods without having its ownership, the acceptance – and consequently the demand – for remanufactured goods is significantly improved. This paper presents guidelines for the definition of innovative business models for remanufacturing, utilizing both remanufacturing and PSS characteristics, and permitting the dissemination of knowledge needed for successful implementation within a company strategy and operations model. Focusing on industrial PSS, an illustrative application of the guidelines is demonstrated.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies are striving to create new sources of value, providing integrated product-service solutions to customers, evolving from a “pure product” orientation towards a Product-Service System (PSS) perspective. In this context, Service Engineering (SE), the discipline concerned with the systematic development and design of product-services, is becoming a predominant field. Most of the available Service Engineering models, methods and tools come from traditional engineering, business and computer science approaches adapted to the Service System or Product-Service System. In order to fill this gap, this paper proposes a Service Engineering framework that integrates a product-service design modelling tool developed at the Tokyo Metropolitan University with a discrete event simulation test-bench, enabling the comparison of several PSS configurations considering both customer satisfaction measures and internal performance. A sample case is reported to exemplify the different phases of the framework implementation.

Abstract: Abstract
For the management of the delivery of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2), an IPS2-Execution System (IPS2-ES) can be used. This software system provides means of managing the provider network as well as planning the IPS2 delivery. However, to execute these tasks, different types of data are required and have to be collected from the different partners involved in the lifecycle of IPS2. This paper describes which data types are needed to efficiently and effectively organize the IPS2 delivery. Additionally, the origin of each data type is shown and a way of connecting network partners as virtual organization units to the IPS2-ES is described. Conclusively, an outlook for further research is given.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service System lifecycle is characterized by several phases from the initial concept to the final disposal. However, as for conventional products, the profit generation and the market success of PSSs critically depend on the decisions taken during the initial lifecycle stages, when PSSs are conceptualized, designed, developed and engineered. These are hence the phases deserving more attention in order to manage the intrinsic complexity of such systems, taking it in account during the entire PSS life cycle design phase. According to this, one of the main gaps detected in the PSS design process is the lack of methods able to support the early integration of service features during the product design. In this specific context DfX approaches, where X= x-bility stands for enhancing products design considering at the same time service features to be embedded on it (x) according to certain performance measures (-bility), are supposed to significantly contribute. The Serviceability point of view appears to be a critical aspect of the design of product-oriented PSS that has not been improving yet: significant enhancement in this products’ characteristic will only occur if some changes will arise in the way they are designed. Indeed companies still need guidelines able to enhance the PSS design process in a more systematic way. On this basis, due to the main gap of integrating service features in the product design process, the paper presents and defines DfX approaches enlightening, among the several target properties they have been called to improve so far, the most suitable DfX streams detected to solve the reported PSS design issue and to define Design for Product Service Supportability (DfPSS).

Abstract: Abstract
The combination of products and services in an integrated offer that delivers value through the provision of a required function is recognized as an important strategy for competitiveness and environmental perspectives. Despite its benefits, the design of a Product-Service System (PSS) is considered more challenging than the design of pure products and services. There are proposals of generic models of PSS design processes to support companies when creating their specific models. This paper presents a comparative analysis of the five most cited generic process models, addressing a level of granularity based on process activities, meanwhile other studies have mostly stopped at the phase level. It employed a content analysis approach to perform the comparative analysis. The results show that the analyzed process models prioritize activities related to “Conceptualization” and “Technical Development (Product, Service and Software, Integration)” categories of the PSS design. They also focus on different parts of these categories, being complementary to each other. Thus, this study suggests that companies should not choose only one of them as a reference to create its own PSS design process, but they should look for elements of different models that fit to their purposes and characteristics. At the end, perspectives for future research are discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
The introduction of clean energy vehicles (CEVs) is expected to improve environmental efficiency in the transportation sector. However, the popularization of each CEV type has different impacts on economic, social, and environmental aspects across life cycle, because CEVs have a different parts structure from that of gasoline vehicles (GVs). Because CEVs affect many aspects of the social system, it is necessary to analyze CEVs in the context of product-service systems (PSS), which bring together products (CEVs) and service (public service), rather than focusing on individual products.

Also, the popularization of CEVs will affect employment especially, as CEVs generate demand in different industries compared with GVs. There are labor- and capital-intensive industries, and the number of jobs will vary depending on the supply chain characteristics of each CEV. However, most existing studies do not consider the impacts on employment when CEVs are popularized in a society. Therefore, by quantitatively assessing the social sustainability of PSS that are centered on CEVs and public service, in this study, we evaluate and analyze the ripple effects on employment under some scenarios. Our simulation results show that compared with 2010, the employment effects of the popularization of CEVs in 2030 are expected to decrease by about 37,000 people in Japan.

Abstract: Abstract
In a context of high competitiveness, companies have to improve their activities in terms of excellence but also of nature. Continuously, limits are being blurred between physical and intangible means to fulfill consumers’ needs. Automotive industry, historically structured on the basis of a manufacturing company, is nowadays challenged on many subjects: sustainability, economic globalization, and new ways of consumption. The paper explores a key concept to operate this shift entitled Product-Service System (PSS). More precisely, a review is proposed concerning PSS concept and its applications. A specific focus is given on the automotive industry. First, a survey of numerous PSS definitions is proposed. Secondly, methodologies developed to support PSS implementation are reviewed. Finally, the paper presents an overview on PSS applications, with a particular focus on the automotive industry.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to the increased pressure from today's globalized economy, companies need to develop innovative systems in order to achieve greater market competitiveness. Product-Service Systems (PSS) are one possibility to realize this. In order to successfully realize PSS, their surrounding social subsystemscontaining vital stakeholders such as suppliers and service providers, legislative bodies and users, need to be designed and developed along with the technical components. In order to achieve this, the modelling of large and complex sociotechnical systems becomes necessary. These sociotechnical systems result from the existence of multiple social and technical subsystems within PSS that are highly interconnected. Various tools for the analysis of complex sociotechnical systems exist, however there are currently no systematic approaches available in PSS research to describe these sociotechnical systems in order to create comparable system models. This paper describes the development of a metamodel for modeling of such sociotechnical systems. The approach applied is a combination of a literature survey into existing approaches of PSS metamodeling and the abstraction of concrete models created based on a case study of a bike sharing system developed by students. In the future, the metamodel will be refined, formalized, and used as a basis to conduct e.g. complexity analyses of sociotechnical systems of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems are increasingly emerging in response to market volatility and more demanding customer requirements. Their development process, however, is not as straightforward as for traditional physical goods. For instance, the configuration of a Product-Service System entails taking several factors into account, such as the points of view of the different actors in the value network. This paper proposes a methodological framework supported by modelling and simulation to evaluate the performance of different configurations of the value network, referred to as scenarios, and the impact of different input parameters within these scenarios. The proposed approach is illustrated by a case study which highlights the main drivers of a new innovative sector for sludge treatment.

Abstract: Abstract
The world economy has seen the evolution of predominant economic activities. Frompre-industrial society based on extractive activities (primary sector), through the industrial era characterized by the production of consumer goods (secondary sector), to the post-industrial age with predominance of the service sector (tertiary sector). In addition, more recently,it has been integrated with the products. i.e. PSS (Product-Service System) an integrated combination of products and services. A PSS can be thought of as a market proposition that extends the traditional functionality of a product by incorporating additional services. The primary aim of thispaper is to evaluate the criteria and sub-criteria of theimplementation of PSS (point of view of operations), based on the quality dimensions, through of hybrid methodology (Fuzzy Delphi – FDELPHI and Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process – FAHP). The fuzzy Delphi method was used to validate the criteria and sub-criteria taken from the literature. FAHP method to calculate the relative weights of the selected criteria and sub-criteria. The questionnaire (based on the quality dimensions) was applied to a large company located in Paraná, Brazil,which has the intention of implementing PSS. The results show that the criteria that were relevant to the company: C3 (Restructuring) had the high weight (17.80%), C9 (Assurance) (15.38%) and C4 (Innovation and Technology) (13.26%). Regarding sub-criteria (global weight), the most influential are“Sc46 (learning and understanding of requirements of necessity and customer satisfaction) 5.55%), Sc14, Sc15, Sc17 and Sc18 (Restructuring) (3.54%, 3.35%, 3.30% and 3.00% respectively). Thus, this work is expected to contribute to improvement in the management of product-service system (PSS) innovation and to provide competitive advantages.

Abstract: Abstract
The research field of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) is not fully mature and there is a need to expand research directions to improve design models. Despite the current IPS2's potential as a business model for a more sustainable production and consumption system, a generic model at global level does not necessarily brings improvement in sustainability. One way of giving a more accurate meaning to sustainability is the territorial understanding of the term. Thus, shifting design level from global to regional or local levels could interpret sustainability more articulate, current, and pragmatic. The present paper discusses territorialisation as a new approach for supporting the design of Industrial Product–Service Systems. To respond to such a need, designers need to access geographical information that able them to integrate territorial specifications in a proper way. In such a context, ontology could play a relevant role to analyse and discover the relation of geographical information system (GIS) in the life cycle of a product and the related service networks. Improvement in sustainability could be a result of this integration. The focus of this paper is just on environmental pillar.

Abstract: Abstract
After having been planned, developed and implemented, Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) enter the operation phase of the IPS2 lifecycle. During the operation phase, the IPS2 provider is facing the challenge to effectively and efficiently schedule IPS2 delivery processes and assign available resources from the IPS2 network. IPS2 delivery planning is an optimization problem of great complexity which is subject to various constraints within a large solution space. Computational support is needed to systematically exploit IPS2-specific planning flexibility options and find close-to-optimum planning solutions. For this purpose, an IPS2 planning method has been development and prototypically implemented in an IPS2 Execution System. In this paper, a first evaluation of the implemented planning method in an industrial setting is presented. The results indicate that the planning method for IPS2 delivery planning generally satisfies the requirements of the industrial evaluation partner. Possibilities for further development as well as limitations of the IPS2 delivery planning approach are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
This study proposes five kinds of game theoretic models of platform-type product service systems considering manufacturing viewpoints. Recently, manufacturing industries face a strong trend towards servicizing. One possible solution to manufacturer's servicizing is a fusional framework incorporating products and services. Such a fusional product service system is able to enhance product functionality and consumers’ satisfaction by constructing appropriate formation of them. Along with this background, our preceding study presented categorization of actual business and three basic models, especially focusing on platform-type business like smart phones, online music stores and electronic books (Nishino et al., 2012). The current study presents an extension of the models and conducts its game-theoretic analysis. Constructing five kinds of platform-type product service system models, the present study derives the theoretical equilibrium of each model. Then we discuss the characteristics of each model and manufacturers’ strategy in platform-type business.

Abstract: Abstract
Which business models successfully compete in the electric mobility market? High initial costs for electric vehicles and a slow adoption to the mass market result for many companies in almost insurmountable barriers to entry. The presented article introduces a framework for the analysis of e-mobility business models by defining central business model patterns, customer segments and essential key values of electric mobility. Thereby, the aim is to systematically identify e-mobility business model potentials. From the perspective of all stakeholders involved, this helps to overcome existing barriers to entry. Interviews with several mobility, energy and infrastructure providers have been conducted to apply the theoretical framework and to ultimately answer the opening question as follows: Those business models which at least address one aspect of the so called “multifunctional utilisation of electric vehicles” or a high service orientation have the best chances to successfully compete in the electric mobility market.

Abstract: Abstract
Product services systems (PSS) provide a promising opportunity for industries to propose both prosper and eco-friendly solutions to fulfill consumer needs. By shifting from traditional offer, comprised of physical products, to an integrated solution of product and services, it is assumed that PSS may reduce the environmental impact and provide benefits for the PSS provider and the consumer in economic and social ways. However, sustainability is not intrinsic characteristic of PSS. Operational methods and tools are needed to help companies develop such business models and supportcustomer choices relating to PSS contracts. Although there are already well established assessment methods in literature, such as Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing, there is still a lack of evidences from the particular field of PSS. Further on, most of existing methods and tools dealing with PSS assessment are based on qualitative parameters, which are subjective and hard to evaluate, anddo not provide detailed views of the results.This paper analyses this piece of literature (i.e. relating to PSS assessment) to emphasize similarities and differences between available methods and tools. The aim is to identify the issues underpinning the development of methods for sustainable design in the particular case of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
High-tech products from mechanical and plant engineering play a leading role in world trade. Because of their high sales potential, they represent an attractive business opportunity and are, therefore, in competition with similar products from different countries. In this context, the concept of Industrial Product-Service System (IPS2) provides a possibility for competitive differentiation by offering a holistic problem solution including an integrative combination of a physical core product and related services. The article at hand focuses on the strategic planning of IPS2. The strategic planning has to ensure the long-term effectiveness of an IPS2. Effectiveness implies that an IPS2 is target-oriented. Thus, an effective IPS2 generates the required technical and economic customer benefit in accordance with profitability conditions. In order to maintain effectiveness over time, the IPS2 has to be adapted if the requirements change. Hence, ensuring long-term effectiveness involves the consideration of uncertainty regarding the future state of the environment and subsequent requirements. Changes over time require dynamic analyses. As a consequence, ensuring the IPS2 effectiveness over a long period of time means ensuring the dynamic effectiveness of an IPS2. In order to be able to react to future changes and be dynamically effective, the IPS2 provider has to integrate adaptability into the strategic planning of IPS2. In this regard, the paper at hand presents a multilevel approach for identifying the amount and kind of adaptability needed. This approach helps planning adaptability measures ensuring the dynamic effectiveness if changes are expected. In order to consider the need of adaptability explicitly, an adaptation model is integrated into this approach.

For the purpose of making the functionality of the presented approach more specific, a hypothetical case study will be presented. By the system dynamics approach, the effects of two exemplary personnel capacity measures will be simulated.

Abstract: Abstract
Cars and machines are developed today based on a selection of specific parameters fulfilling the requirements of targeted customers. However, this approach is not commonly adopted in service engineering. Therefore, this research approach aims to systematically develop a series of service parameters to enhance the effectiveness of industrial service systems for establishing new services. As proposed a combination of these parameters shall fulfill any demand resulting from the requirements analysis. Consequently services can be systematically designed with a tool box of parameters. Furthermore, previously designed services can have demanded adjustment to match the requirements of the new services, based on a reselection of the design parameters.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper is a focus study to introduce an alternative approach to the existing ones, which could be taken to implement Additive Manufacturing (AM) systems for industrial applications. This approach is mainly based on the use of Product Service Systems (PSS) concept in order to turn AM into a more relevant field for service-based purposes within industrial applications. To do so, an AM profile, which is characterized with the similar notions forming the conceptual basis of PSS is detailed, and then the profile is framed for the new service oriented approach to highlight AM's competences in this field. Having found the interconnecting links between these two concepts, the intended approach for implementation would then be discussed and further developed in more detail to include the best use cases of the previous AM case studies as a guide on how to exploit AM's capabilities in similar ways, only modified for a given industrial business which is based on service development. The use cases would also introduce a few of the most successful examples in the production-service systems which have already taken advantage of three-dimensional printing (3D printing) which is one the subcategories of AM in lower tier (desktop) applications. These customer scale applications of 3D printing alongside portfolio analysis of AM in the field of industrial services could shed light for implementing further service-centric research in the advanced manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Abstract
The sustainability and re-configurability of a dynamic cellular manufacturing system (DCMS) play significant roles for enterprises in their rapid response to the ever changing market, while increasing their competitive power. Because of a lack of an efficient standard for implementing manufacturing and service integration, the configuration and operation architecture for Product–Service System (PSS) supporting DCMS remains a problem. In order to improve operation sustainability and re-configurability of DCMS, a configuration and operation architecture for Dynamic Cellular Manufacturing Product–Service System (DCM-PSS) based on function block is presented, and key techniques of configuration and operation of DCM-PSS are studied. The real-time dynamically reconfigurable and sustainable DCM-PSS can be implemented by means of the function block standard and Web Services middleware, which is verified through prototype system design and running instances. Because of the low cost of designing, developing and maintaining DCM-PSS due to its simple, open and scalable architecture, it can not only satisfy the requirement of developing dynamic cellular manufacturing system for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs), but also provide high-value-added services for DCMS manufacturers.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrialising products and/or services, considering the current environmental situation, requires changing paradigms to be efficient. The paradigm of proposing product-service systems instead of selling products is one of them. Moving further, this article shows that it can sometimes be possible to consider product and/or service degradation in order to relieve environmental burdens, while still maintaining user satisfaction. In this new paradigm, degradation will concern certain technical performances of the system. To succeed, the approach must simultaneously consider users' expectations and environmental aspects. Environmental, economic and innovative approaches must be combined to adapt the products and services in an appropriate way. The product and service characteristics are negotiated with the users to cut down environmental impacts, while continuing to meet users' satisfaction. A case study of an eco-designed product-service system is presented.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) are integrated product and service offerings that deliver superior customer value in industrial applications by mutually determined planning, development, delivery and use of product and service shares. A particular challenge for the provision of IPS2 is the planning of resources, e.g. field service engineers (FSE). As a consequence, organizations which offer IPS2 or industrial services experience a lack of decision support in determining robust capacity planning strategies in highly dynamic and uncertain environments. In this paper, a simulation-based capacity planning approach is introduced. The focus is on capacity planning of FSE for IPS2 delivery in IPS2 or service networks. After some general considerations on robust capacity planning for IPS2 delivery with the help of scenario simulations, the core elements of the agent-based simulation approach are presented. The most important parameters, control variables and performance indicators are discussed and the procedure of simulation-based scenario planning is outlined.

Abstract: Abstract
In recent years, the distinction between manufacturing and services has been blurring. They are often combined together to provide customers a total offering for better economic performance. At same time, manufacturers are facing rising pressures from government, society and end users to reduce the impacts of their products and services on environmental sustainability throughout the supply chain. As a result, Product-Services System (PSS) was developed to drive for both business excellence and environmental sustainability. The application of Lean and Green thinking in supply chain management has also shown the advantage of addressing the two issues. However, there is a lack of systematic research on how Lean and Green thinking could support the development of PSS supply chain, esp. in the fields of supplier collaboration and relationship development across the product life cycle. For instance, how can Lean and Green help reshaping the supplier structure and network? Which Lean and Green tools can promote the supplier relationship? From literature review, this paper summarizes the state-of-art researches on PSS, Lean/Green supply chain management and the connections between them. Then a conceptual framework of Lean and Green supply chain for PSS is constructed to guide the case studies in next steps.

This paper proposes a framework relying on a combination of a methodological approach with a modelling and simulation platform. The methodological approach offers generic tools to collect and analyze the key information required to understand a PSS industrial context. Modelling and simulation areconcerned with the specification and evaluation of alternative PSS value-chain configurations. A case studyin the field of sludge treatment is used to illustrate the proposed approach. This case study points out the main performance drivers for the different types of actor involved in the PSS. The novelty of the paper is twofold: i) it provides a structural and methodological support to build and evaluate different value-chain configurations aiming at deliver PSS solutions, and ii) it gives a preliminary analysis of the performance drivers of an innovative activity related to sludge treatment.

Abstract: Abstract
Strategies for sustainable development are arguably part of the most discussed issues among political and corporate actors. These discussions are spurred by global challenges such as climate change, urbanization, and critical natural resource depletion. Sustainable development will require deep structural and wide-reaching changes in current institutions, technologies, and businesses. Furthermore, new approaches are needed to facilitate the development, diffusion, and implementation of environmental technologies. In the academic discourse different concepts, e.g., ecodesign and Product/Service System design, have been proposed within the framework of sustainable development. To deliver even more system-wide environmental improvements, these concepts have been challenged to be expanded in focus beyond products and services to include large technical systems encompassing non-technological dimensions. Motivated by these, the goal of this article is twofold. First, to offer an expanded view on ecodesign of Product/Service Systems using a perspective of large technical systems. Second, to propose and discuss important components to consider when developing business concepts for the diffusion of large scaled environmental technology systems such as district heating supply, waste management, and renewable energy systems. Using qualitative semi-structured interviews and company documentation analysis, this study examines five companies that develop and diffuse large scaled environmental technology systems. As a result of these case studies, we propose components of business concepts that incorporate both technological and non-technological dimensions. Our proposed business concept components are: market (including regulation), finance, resources, activities, partnership (especially public-private partnership), ownership and responsibility, and legitimacy. Regulation, public-private partnership, and legitimacy are particularly important in the diffusion of large scaled environmental technology systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Previous research has investigated transitions of individual firms to PSS business. It has identified barriers and enablers and specified organizational capabilities needed. However, the transition to PSS has seldom been approached from a product-chain perspective. In addition, previous research has indicated the need for more assessments of environmental gains related to PSSs. This study aims at contributing to these perceived knowledge gaps by means of a case study. Questions posed include: Does the study's case company and one of its suppliers have the capabilities needed to adopt a PSS business model? and Could a PSS really contribute to material efficiency in their product-chain?

Abstract: Abstract
Machine tool manufacturers realized that offering a high quality technical product is not sufficient considering the rising customer requirements. To commit customers and differ from the competitors machine tool manufacturers provide services which support the production of their customers. To guarantee a high quality Product-Service Systems (PSS) machine tool manufacturers have to analyze how well their PSS fulfills the requirements of the customers. Therefore, an assessment tool is necessary to control the quality of PSS.

In this paper a software demonstrator is presented that serves for assessing the quality of PSS. The demonstrator is developed during a project with machine tool manufacturers. An overview of the project results will be presented by means of developed use cases and determined requirements of the lead-users of the project partners. Based on the customer requirements of the lead-users quality criteria are developed and clustered to generally valid PSS quality criteria. To measure the PSS quality criteria Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) are developed with the project partners. These KPIs are monitored within the software demonstrator which supports machine tool manufacturers to measure and control their PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
The innovation process of Product Service Systems (PSS) is affected by a vast number of internal and external influences. Especially the management of timely or structurally repeating influences, so called cycles, shows a great potential for improving the innovation process. Thereby two types of cycles can be differentiated. Firstly, internal cycles during the innovation process itself going from engineering change cycles, to manufacturing resource cycles or even team building processes. Secondly, the external, environmental cycles that have an impact on the innovation process, i.e. government- and customer-related demands and dependencies. A lot of these dependencies, most likely external ones, contain uncertainties, that have to be handled for successful innovation of PSS.

To cope with these struggles, methods and tools have to be developed, to allow analysis and forecast of the cycles in the innovation process. Especially the high degree of cross-linking between the different cycles indicates the need of integrated modeling and analysis. An interdisciplinary cycle network of 30 relevant cycles and external influences as well as 51 interconnections so far, was set up in a System Dynamics environment. Though not all influences can be determined yet, the created causal loop diagram can already serve as a framework for analyzing the innovation process of PSSs and support deeper understanding of the interdisciplinary interdependencies.

Abstract: Abstract
Knowledge management has drawn great interest in manufacturing industries and related business practices. With the requirement for better managing the massive data and knowledge generated during different lifecycle stages of products, manufacturing industries are looking for effective way to acquire, store, process and share knowledge from and between different stakeholders, so as to make appropriate decisions and continuously improve business operations. Current (conventional) engineering information systems in manufacturing applications, such as Enterprise Resource Planning, Computerized Maintenance Management and Product Lifecycle Management Systems are difficult to inter-operate and integrate with each other when dealing with growing amount of data and knowledge as a product goes through its lifecycle stages. As informational and communication technologies (ICT) are being developed much faster in other sectors such as financial, business and social media, it is important to explore the potential of latest ICT tools predominantly used in those sectors for engineering applications and identify any advantages and benefits over the conventional engineering information systems. This paper presents an experiment in using an Open Source Content Management System, for the implementation of a collaborative product-service system for the planning and execution of maintenance and service operations of high-value complex numerical control machine tools in advanced manufacturing systems.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents disciplines for designing actor network of Product-Service Systems by visualizing state changes in design process and indicating tasks for state transitions. While IT vendors co-design new services with their clients, sporadic requirements and constraints may leave target users and business partners unsettled in the conceptual IT service system. IT vendors design a hypothetic service system and check it continuously through ad hoc workshops. They gradually identify such actors from possible groups of people, though this design procedure is still improvisational. A set of states and tasks is described indicating what PSS designers need to do next with possible actors, instilling correct disciplines for establishing relationships between them.

Abstract: Abstract
Studies on PSS are emerging as a growing body of literature driven by the desire to reach economic aspects and sustainable resource management. Although recent studies have highlighted environmental benefits of PSS, insights about how companies can systematically obtain eco-innovations in PSS design, using only TRIZ or TRIZ combined with other methodologies, are still limited. In this sense, aiming to identify the state of the art eco-innovation practices with TRIZ in PSS, a literature review was conducted. Findings were accumulated in order to present the current research framework in this research field. Trends and research opportunities also were identified.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service-Systems (PSS) have gained tremendous attention in research and industry over the past years [1–4].Manufacturing firmstransform from providing pure productstowards providing integrated products and services [2]. This development is triggered by the increasing customer demand forPSS and the opportunity of manufacturers to differentiate themselves from their competitors as services are hard to replicate. For providing PSS companies need to go throughfundamental changes which range from organizational adaptions within the company structure over novel development processes to improving the customer relationship. In this paper the authors describe requirements for providing PSS which werederived from a case study with a crane manufacturer and an extensive literature research. These requirements are considered with respect to the different PSS business models related to the PSS types defined by Tukker [5]. Furthermore the implementation of one of these requirements in the case company is described.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing companies whose products have become increasingly commoditized are currently striving to identify innovative value propositions allowing them to re-position themselves in the market. This is gradually leading to a business shift from delivering traditional transaction-based, product-centric offering to the provision of integrated product-service systems (PSS). However, the number of companies failing in successfully pursue such a transition is still increasing. Consequently, Service Engineering (SE), a discipline concerned with the systematic development and design of services and product-services, is gaining particular interest in both the scientific and practitioner communities. This paper contributes to these fields by proposing a complete overview of the applicability of the SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) in an industrial context. The SEEM aims at supporting companies approaching the introduction of PSSs in their portfolio and suggests a structured decision-making process to (i) define the PSS offering most aligned with company product(s) and customer needs, (ii) (re-)engineer the (existing) service delivery processes, and (iii) balance the external performance (e.g. customer satisfaction, delivery time, service cycle time) with the internal performance (i.e. efficiency) of the service delivery process. The noteworthy benefits achievable through the SEEM are illustrated through a real case at the industrial partner ABB – a multinational company providing power and automation solutions. The implementation of all the SEEM steps is thoroughly described, and the advantages experienced along with the difficulties encountered are highlighted. Managerial implications and the main gaps to address in future research are also discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
Energy is a fundamental imperative to the quest for sustainable development. The current challenge is to provide sustainable energy solutions for all, whilst concomitantly increasing the access to energy and improving its efficiency. Within this perspective, design Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) need to be able to equip design students with a broad knowledge base, as well as effective methods and tools so that a new generation of designers (and design educators) can play an active role in the development and diffusion of sustainable energy systems. This is the ambition of the Learning Network on Sustainable Energy Systems (LeNSes) project – an African-European multi-polar network for curricula development on Product-Service System (S.PSS) Design for Sustainability applied to Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE). The research working hypothesis of the LeNSes project is that S.PSS could be effectively applied to DRE, representing a promising opportunity to couple several benefits: economical, environmental, and socio-ethical ones.

Abstract: Abstract
In recent times a service-dominant logic is permeating the design of complex systems. However, in spite of their appeal, initiatives such as Product Service Systems (PSS) have not become mainstream, and methods are lacking to support this transition. This paper argues that methodological guidance, as well as tools for decision support, may be found in the research field of Value Driven Design (VDD), which originates in the realm of Systems Engineering. The paper objective is to elaborate on gaps and opportunities for cross-pollination between VDD and PSS. The results of a systematic review of methods and tools for design decision support highlight the opportunity for introducing optimization models derived from VDD in the PSS design process, while the latter can enrich VDD research with a more qualitative value assessment logic. The paper summarizes this integration in a methodological approach, and exemplifies its application in case studies mainly from the aerospace and road construction equipment sector.

Abstract: Although the importance of the design of a new PSS (Product-Service System) should be emphasized, it is not obvious that traditional evaluation methods of pure services are still appropriate for PSSs. Since methods to evaluate the feasibility of new businesses vary with the characteristics of businesses, the evaluation methods might need to be modified to reflect unique nature in the design of a new PSS. Therefore, this paper aims at improving the applicability of evaluation methods for designing a new PSS by proposing a new framework and performing an empirical study where a new evaluation method can be used for PSSs. To this end, first, the meanings of service innovation, PSS, and evaluation methods in service research will be investigated. Second, an evaluation method for designing a new PSS will be suggested by considering the perspectives of service providers as well as customers. Finally, the method will be applied to evaluate the feasibility of designing a car-sharing service that is a use-oriented PSS. This method will provide a good means of drawing a potentially successful PSS by applying the proposed evaluation methodology and process.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies providing Product-Service Systems (PSS) can gain competitive advantages by addressing the customer needs in a more precise way than regular product manufacturer. However, achieving these benefits also increases the responsibility on the company's side because the value of a PSS is delivered during the use phase. In many cases a provider stays the owner of the PSS and is thus responsible for the performance during the use. Accordingly, the PSS provider acts not only as a manufacturer but also as a service provider, which requires a constant monitoring of the PSS performance (e.g., service availability or customer satisfaction). The implementation of a performance measurement system is an approach to cope with the additional responsibilities during the use phase. However, different publications exist that offer support for the development phase of PSS but the performance assessment during the use phase is not addressed sufficiently, even though the importance in mentioned by different authors. This paper thus proposes two generic processes to address the identified need for the performance assessment of PSS. The first process guides through the implementation of an entire performance measurement system, and the other process describes the development of PSS specific key performance indicators (KPIs). The proposed approach applies KPIs to a new context and supports PSS providers in implementing a performance measurement system, which allows them to initiate measure to increase the PSS performance.

Abstract: Abstract
Increasingly the thinking of sustainability becomes important in the design of Industrial Product Service Systems (IPSS) especially in the field of maintenance. This helps to achieve a longer lifetime of the product system, more efficiency regarding resource and reduces environmental pollution. In the product development it is an established principle to develop products in a sustainable way. But in IPSS the aspect of sustainability has to be considered too. Both - service and product - influence each other in the design of IPSS especially regarding maintenance. To ensure a sustainable design of IPSS, it is necessary to recognize all requirements regarding sustainability along the life cycle of service and product. Thus, an integrated concept for the design of a sustainable IPSS based on a high data quality, in this application field data, for excellence maintenance services is needed.

Abstract: Abstract
Recent research shows that manufacturers’ contribution to sustainable development can be improved by adopting a product service system (PSS). It is argued in this paper that such non-traditional business strategy is a crucial decision to the enterprise. Metrics need to be identified at different levels: industry, enterprise, and product. The objective of this research is to identify PSS metrics for agriculture industry. PESTEL analysis is carried out to determine these metrics. A case study of a grain spreader is used to derive the appropriate metrics. Decision model is developed and its can be implemented by the PSS partners.

Abstract: Abstract
In industrialized contexts Sustainable Product-Service Systems (S.PSS) have been studied since the end of the 90's as business models with the potential to decouple the creation of value from the consumption of materials and energy, and thus significantly reducing the environmental load of the life-cycles of current product systems.

In the framework of the Sustainable Energy for All initiative (United Nations, SE4All decade 2014-2024), the EU funded, LeNSes project - the Learning Network for Sustainable energy systems (Edulink II programme, 2013-2016) has formulated the following Research Hypothesis: “The S.PSS offer model applied to Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE) is a win-win approach to diffuse them (DRE) in low and middle-income (all) contexts, because it reduces/cuts both the initial investment cost of hardware purchasing and the life-cycle costs of maintenance, repair, upgrade, etc. while improving local skills and rising local employment, resulting in a key leverage for a sustainable development process aiming at democratizing the access to resources, goods and services.”

The paper describes the Research Hypothesis, the method adopted for the case studies analysis and the achieved results. The case studies analysis validate the hypothesis and shows various ways in which initial investment costs and life-cycle costs are reduced/cut when a S.PSS model is applied to DRE. These reductions/cuts are present both for Business to Business (B2B) and Business to Consumers (B2C) offers, as well as when the offer is the DRE system alone or when it is coupled with related Energy Using Products (EUP) or Equipment (EUE).

Abstract: Abstract
The present study contributes to the servitization literature demonstrating capability configurations that lead to successful advanced service offerings. Drawing on a data set of 131 Swedish manufacturing firms, the present study utilizes a configurational comparative method, namely fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA), to identify influential capability configurations. This study identifies four capability configurations that enable advanced service offerings in manufacturing companies. The results highlight the importance of a configurational approach towards understanding service capabilities and suggest two key paths based upon service development capabilities and mass service customization capabilities that firms may follow in achieving advanced service offerings.

Abstract: Abstract
In adopting highly integrated Product-Service Systems (PSS), incentive structures change and the value attainable for providers throughout the lifecycle becomes an issue of growing complexity. Nonetheless, value for PSS providers has up to now not been considered in a multidimensional fashion. In an effort to move towards a characterization of provider's value, an offering in the information communication technology sector was examined through an investigation with ten staff-members of Ericsson, Sweden. This led to a value-categorization, which can be utilized in the PSS design process to enhance the value captured throughout the lifecycle beyond immediate monetary benefit. In an effort to provide general learnings, the results are discussed with a focus on PSS business models, PSS design and management communication. Overall, the results presented provide a more comprehensive picture of what a provider has to gain from a PSS offering throughout its entire lifecycle.

Abstract: Abstract
There is a trend increasing number of manufacturing companies offer field service to customers rather than only provide products for higher revenue and stronger competitiveness. However, these companies are experiencing a lack of proper and efficient decision support in maintenance policy selection and service resource planning of service delivery. In this paper, a multi-agent based approach to service decision-making of IPS2 is presented and the performance evaluation result is given. Multi-agent based approach is utilized to model the service delivery network and different agents are generated to present the elements of field service network. Each agent has a distinct state transition and processing mechanism which can be highly coincidence with the actual situation owing to the flexibility and operability of multi-agent based simulation model. Furthermore, negotiation mechanism among the agents is introduced into the multi-agent based simulation model to map the dynamic characteristics in the actual service delivery context. A case study scenario of agricultural machinery maintenance is presented which clearly demonstrated that the proposed approach is efficient and can provide reasonable suggestions to the IPS2 providers.

Abstract: Abstract
Product/Service Systems are conceived to be competitive, satisfy customer needs and have a lower environmental impact than traditional business models. Based on a single case study, this paper analyses the specific sustainable value proposition that a company has designed to replace a low-cost product by an innovative Product Service Solution. The objective of the company is to replace the “shower head” in every hospital room. The concept that was developed does not consist in replacing product “A” by an equivalent product “B”, but in changing radically the offer. The Product Service Solution includes a lifecycle analyses, by integrating environmental social and economic impacts into the different main phases, i.e. beginning of life (BOL), Middle-of-life (MOL) and End-of-life (EOL). Even though the product that was designed to support the service looks very simple, the design of this innovative solution highlights the role of the functional analyses to be more environmental friendly, to improve social issues and finally proposes a new business model based on servicisation. The “shower head” as a service developed by ECOBEL is far beyond the low-cost product used today in the French hospital, by integrating a new sustainable value proposition.

Abstract: Abstract
Product Service Systems are indicated in literature as enablers toward a more sustainable and resource-efficient industry. In particular, the potential of Eco-efficient PSS to promote more sustainable industrial practices, such as re-use and re-manufacturing, has been discussed outlining the possible environmental advantages deriving from a more intense use of resources and emphasizing the economic benefits for producers as well. In recent years, together with barriers hindering the implementation of such strategies, authors started discussing also some ‘rebound effects’ that could limit the expected re-manufacturing environmental benefits, such as the obsolescence of re-manufactured products, especially in case of fast technology cycles. To overcome these criticalities and to target high-value customers segment, the concept of product upgrade in re-manufacturing has been introduced. Upgrade cycles would allow embedding technological innovation into products, to reach advanced environmental performances over time and to satisfy evolving customers’ preferences. However, the concept of product re-manufacturing with upgrade has been treated mainly theoretically with limited evidence of industrial applications in PSS. Producers currently engaged in established remanufacturing practices are mainly big manufacturers of durable or long life-time products, in particular in the B2B sector, while only few pioneering cases of PSS offering product upgrade are cited in literature, mainly referring to B2C. To contribute to the progress of the state of the art and to move from theory to industrial application, this article takes a business model perspective for the implementation of remanufacturing with upgrade PSS. A coherent configuration value proposition, supply chain and reverse logistics, revenue model and ownership scheme is proposed, aiming at addressing the major criticalities and barriers encountered in the literature for the implementation of remanufacturing strategies. The producer will play a central role in the business model, since he has the knowledge and capability to conceive product's design and supply chains suited to perform remanufacturing and upgrade cycles. Potential benefits, and unsolved barriers to the implementation of the proposed business model are finally introduced in order to suggest future research directions.

Abstract: Abstract
Collaborative consumption has been changing how the people consume products in recent years. The economy model has been adapted by rising Start-Ups and enables lower-income consumers to remove the cost barrier by using access-based consumption. However, up until now the research and empirical study about collaborative consumption practice in a developing country with lower-income consumers compared to developed country is very limited. In this paper, we will explore one of the systems of the collaborative consumption, product-service system in term of customer loyalty by using data from babyloania.com, a Start-Up that using this model. We use multiple regression method with 266 transaction data from customers who have already made at least twice transaction and joined as members for at least 4 months to predict the customer lifetime value and check the significance of its antecedents. In our findings, initial perceived value of saving benefit, initial recency, and initial monetary value have significant effect to customer loyalty measured by transaction frequency and customer lifetime value.

Abstract: Abstract
In recent years Mass Customization has been considered as a proper strategy to provide customers with individualized products with a reasonable price. Meanwhile, the trends of aging population and rapid technological evolution have initiated the interest of healthcare sector to production of customized medical devices. Pursuit of such a strategy can result in introduction of manufacturing operations of customized medical devices inside the hospitals. To this end, an innovative business model is required to facilitate and support such a shift by focusing on both product and service perspectives and hence taking into account an integrated product-service system approach. This paper aims at introducing a PSS-oriented business model to support customized production by hospitals. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of pros and cons of each business model configuration is presented in the paper. Eventually, considering each configuration along with its benefits and challenges, the hospital selects the most proper business model base on its strategy and long-term oriented objectives.

Abstract: Abstract
Feedback management systems retrieve information and assist the developing of new product generations. However not only product data like sensor data or maintenance reports but also activities surrounding a customer can lead to an identification of demands connected to the providers’ product. Therefore an approach is needed that extends existing feedback management systems as it creates added value for the customer as well as an expansion of benefits for the provider. This paper presents a morphology that defines and systemizes the necessary dependencies between an IPS2-provider and his customer in order to enable the IPS2-provider to offer value added services based on product diversification.

The model will assess Product-Service System leanness based on five lean enablers (supplier relationship, management leanness, workforce leanness, process excellence, and customer relationship), 21 criteria (supplier delivery, culture of management, process optimisation, etc.) and finally 73 attributes. This proposed model will be the base of developing an index used as quantitative measure of the degree of Product-Service System leanness in manufacturing companies.

Abstract: Abstract
The delivery planning of Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) is a complex task. A highly dynamic network of provider, customers and suppliers needs to be managed and coordinated. Due to this complexity, sophisticated IT-support for IPS2 resource planning is required. For this purpose, the adaptive IPS2 planning method (AIPM) for the scheduling of delivery processes has been conceptually developed in previous research. The method is based on a genetic algorithm, in which a population of planning solutions is evaluated with regard to a fitness value to identify the best plans. To be able to conduct quantitative evaluation studies on the effectiveness and efficiency of the planning algorithm, it has been implemented in a prototype of an IPS2-Execution System (IPS2-ES). It became apparent that some modifications of the algorithms were necessary in order to apply the approach to real planning cases. With these modifications, the algorithm was suitable to be used for further evaluation studies.In this paper, the results of these new evaluation studies with the modified algorithm are presented. A benchmarking problem set of the traveling salesman problem with time windows (TSPTW) and a real-life industrial planning setting were analyzed. The results show, that the revised version of the AIPM is capable of solving both problems satisfactorily. In particular, the planning outcomes in the industrial scenario indicate high potential for practical applications in service companies and IPS2 networks.

Abstract: Abstract
Besides selling tangible products, manufacturing companieshave also started to compete byoffering product-related services throughout the product lifecycle. In this context, the recent riseof cyber-physical systems (CPSs) and smart, connected equipment paves the way for additional opportunities for the service business among the lifecycle and pivots of traditional maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) service business. Based on 11 case studies,we investigate service innovations driven bydigitalization and CPSsand their impact on the service ecosystem.We identify affordances thateffectively exploit the new technological capabilities in existing and future service scenarios.

Abstract: Abstract
The adoption of advanced manufacturing intelligence technologies requires managing the interaction of information in Product-Service Systems (PSS) by combining Product (PLM) and Service Lifecycle Management (SLM). While up to now no sound methodology exists, there is a strong need to have bi-directional coordination and interaction between PLM and SLM in a systematic way. A further challenge is to close loops, for example feedback from service delivery to the beginning-of-life phase of products. The objective of this paper is therefore to identify the interactions between SLM and PLM in manufacturing firms, based on expert interviews and illustrated in PSS use cases.

Abstract: Abstract
Mass Customization (MC) inherently offers the service of individualization of goods and services to customers aiming at better meeting customers’ personal needs. The potential to increase the sustainable performance of businesses by applying MC has been examined in various consumer goods related EU projects so far. Especially, when offering MC as a sustainable Product Service System it is capable of improving the management of the whole product lifecycle. Evidence of this approach has already been presented for some sectors, such as in food and apparel. In other sectors, the interaction between MC and sustainability has not been significantly explored yet. In this paper, we both, theoretically and empirically assess the integration of sustainability in the individualization service offered through user-interfaces, such as in particular configurators. We provide insights from reviewing more than 900 web-based configurators within 16 different industries. Our analysis reveals that only about five percent of all user-interfaces address sustainability issues in their individualization services. By linking our results with the insights gained in our literature review, we make recommendations for the integration of sustainability in the user-interface design. Furthermore, we identify opportunities for future research.

Abstract: Abstract
Change actors like designers play a strategic role in innovation and transition processes towards a sustainable society. They act at all levels of society and need help to find their way through increasingly interrelated innovation systems. To support their efforts, there is a need for a design supportive model that (1) can provide insight into the development of new products and product-service systems, as well as in developments that occur in society as a whole; (2) can provide insight into the relationship between functional problems on the one hand, and more abstract societal problems on the other; (3) describe design processes, change processes and transition processes in a consistent, mutually comparable manner that can potentially be used to structure future design-based initiatives. In this paper a Multilevel Design Model (MDM) is discussed, combining two specific functionalities: First a cyclic iterative design approach that may be generic enough to describe both the design of physical artefacts and the design of product-service systems, as well as the way that complex societal change processes may occur. Second a hierarchical systems approach, where on each aggregation level a similar description of the design, change or transition process is applied. The MDM is discussed by means of a simulated case example in the area sustainable transportation and electric transport, explaining the model may indeed be useful to describe and potentially explain some of the dilemmas that occur during the course of complex design processes.

Abstract: Abstract
One major goal of the Rethinking Prototyping project is to bring scientists from different domains like engineering and arts to explore collaboratively new approaches of development and testing of Product Service Systems (PSS). PSS combine products, services, and infrastructure to fulfil individual customer needs. Therefore, the development of PSS is an extension of traditional engineering design process, which mainly refers to purely tangible products or intangible services into an integrated development process of products and services.

The basis is a new technology called Smart Hybrid Prototyping (SHP), a joint development by Fraunhofer IPK and the TU Berlin. SHP is an innovative technology for a multimodal interdisciplinary evaluation of virtual prototypes in early development stages. It is based upon methods of Mixed Reality extended by modern industrial technologies to allow natural interaction with virtual prototypes of mechanical or mechatronic systems. It serves as a bridge between physical reality and digital virtuality.

The use cases in this paper are based on urban bike mobility. Therefore, three concepts have been worked out to specify main requirements for an urban hybrid bike simulator. The first use case is from the perspective of a bicycle rental, where rental services for the users can be developed, validated, and optimized. The second use case provides the integration of mobile devices like smartphones and tablets for the development and validation of mobile services for bicyclists. The third use case is oriented on development and validation of new bicycles and urban mobility concepts like e-bikes, pedelecs, tripelecs and sharing services. Based on these generic use cases the requirements on a hybrid bicycle simulator were derived.

Why a bicycle simulator? Well, we are firmly convinced that the future of urban mobility is determined from trends such as ecological rethinking and the desire for sports and healthy life. Furthermore, it is one of the most competitive and agile markets using most innovative materials and manufacturing technologies.

Abstract: Abstract
Additive Manufacturing (AM) technologies disclose mass customisation and agile manufacturing, along with fully-digitised supply chains lowering the environmental impact. Concurrently, the progressive servitisation of products builds on new sustainable consumption paradigms, closer to the customer needs. The two mutually-enforcing subject matters are thus tightly intertwined in leveraging on custom-tailored, green and on-demand solutions. In this paper, we investigate the relation between AM and Product-Service Systems (PSS) according to different and interdependent categories pertaining to lifecycle, service orientation and customer proximity. We present a descriptive template that may facilitate – without demanding completeness – the individuation of common traits and patterns in AM-based services. This study represents a preliminary effort to systematise a cutting-edge technology with a PSS standpoint and to pave the way for future research.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing companies being within the transformation process into a product-service system (PSS) provider face the challenge that they have to build up knowledge for successfully providing services. This paper presents an approach for evaluating the knowledge within a company and to specify the required knowledge for providing a specific PSS. Based on that, the knowledge gap can be derived. The basis are Multiple-Domain Matrix (MDM) based knowledge maps that model employees of the companies, their tasks as well as the knowledge required for fulfilling the tasks. This paper contributes furthermore by enhancing the MDM-based knowledge maps by assessing knowledge levels. The approach is illustrated in a case study within a company of the mechanical engineering sector.

Abstract: Abstract
In comparison to traditional product development the concept of product-service systems (PSS) integrates the traditional functionality of a product with services. This offers several advantages for involved stakeholders, such as added value for the customers and long-term customer relationships or more sustainable products by long-term product lifecycles. This conceptual change results in new challenges for the development and organization of PSS. This paper discusses PSS development and modeling as well as indicates limitations in tools and methods to model and simulate dynamic behavior of PSS based on literature. The approach of agent-based modeling (ABM) is a fairly new dynamic modeling approach and has been rarely discussed in PSS literature. As a bottom-up approach it represents system components as a collection of autonomous decision-making entities called agents. The agents have their own individual set of rules or behaviors by which they operate and interact with each other in a certain environment. These characteristic features seem to be a promising approach to support PSS development. The objective of this paper is to prove this assumption and to disclose areas where ABM can be used in PSS development. In this paper ABM is used to simulate the distribution of the e-bike sharing system PSSycle. The model shows on an exemplary use case of the PSSycle the minimal amount of e-bikes which should be distributed in a certain area to ensure an increasing user satisfaction with the PSSycle. The case study demonstrates the applicability of ABM to support PSS development. The results of the case study are also used to discuss further applications of ABM on PSS development.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial product service systems (IPS2) are holistic, innovative and customer individual problem solutions. An IPS2 includes integratively developed product and service modules. The integrative character challenges the IPS2 development by steering interactions between people from different disciplines (product and service) within the provider's company. Further, the provision of IPS2 requires various competences. Consequently, the IPS2 provider needs cooperation partners in order to fill competence gaps and to concentrate on own core competencies. This kind of interaction has also to be steered target-oriented. Further, the long duration of IPS2 business relationships and incomplete information about future changes cause uncertainty in the decision making along the IPS2 lifecycle. An innovative method for steering interactions and dealing with uncertainty is the Intellectual Capital Statement (ICS). The goal of the ICS is the early detection and target-oriented development of intangible innovation and success potentials. It goes beyond the traditional financial balance sheet and focuses on three kinds of capital, namely human capital, structural capital and relational capital. As the ICS focuses on intangibles, its application to the IPS2 context appears reasonable. The main difference by using ICS for IPS2 is that this method is dimensioned for companies as well as single departments. The challenge is to transfer the ICS from the system boundary of one firm to an IPS2 and therefore to a network of companies. This paper gives answers to the questions why an ICS is necessary in the context of IPS2 and what adjustments are required in order to adapt ICS for IPS2.

Abstract: Abstract
In PSS design, hardware and service developers often have different objectives. Lacking to communicate and negotiate them across boundaries might lead to solutions unable to generate market shares and long-term profitability. This paper aims to contribute to the definition of ‘boundary objects’ that facilitate the sharing of knowledge between members of cross-functional teams engaged in PSS conceptual design activities. Empirical data are gathered from three case studies in the Swedish manufacturing industry to reveal how servitization affects early stage design decision-making, and how hardware vs. service trade-offs are negotiated and solved. The analysis of the findings points to four main trends to be considered when designing such objects in the realm of PSS. These are: an underlying model-based logic, the use of metrics based on customer value, the ability to quickly generate and assess scenarios, the use of non linear relationships to map PSS features vs. customer value.

Abstract: A new trend of product–service systems (PSSs) that has the potential to minimise environmental impacts of both production and consumption is emerging. This article attempts to build a theoretical framework for PSS and serves as a background for identifying possible investment needs in studying them. There are three main uncertainties regarding the applicability and feasibility of PSSs: the readiness of companies to adopt them, the readiness of consumers to accept them, and their environmental implications. The main finding is that successful PSSs will require different societal infrastructure, human structures and organisational layouts in order to function in a sustainable manner.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainable Product–Service Systems (S.PSS) carry great potential to deliver social well-being and economic prosperity while operating within the limits of our planet. They can however be complex to design, test, implement and bring to the mainstream. To increase our understanding of the potential benefits, drivers and barriers in S.PSS design, the research community has been inspired to collect and analyse an extensive number of cases in diverse sectors and to develop and test several design methods and tools. This Special Volume on “New Design Challenges to Widely Implement ‘Sustainable Product–Service Systems’” presents results of key studies in the following areas: user satisfaction and acceptance of S.PSS solutions, how industrial partnerships and stakeholder interactions can be designed for environmental and socio-ethical benefits, how knowledge of socio-technical change and transition management feeds S.PSS design processes, and the role of policy instruments to foster their implementation and scale-up. This Introduction reviews the current state of research and summarises the articles presented. The articles demonstrate increasing confidence in integrating approaches and theoretical frameworks from other arenas. These approaches include sociological practice theory, to shed new light on consumer practices in S.PSS configurations, and strategic niche management, to foster a suitable design and experimentation milieu. Experimentation, iteration and cyclical design processes were also seen by many authors as crucial to implementing and stabilising S.PSS solutions, but also their continuous sustainability evaluation. Several articles highlight the importance of local authorities, in developing S.PSS-enabling policies as well as supporting novel networks of stakeholders in the co-production of value. Finally this Introduction highlights key issues for a design research agenda, including but not limited to the development of new knowledge to support S.PSS designers (such as S.PSS design in low and middle-income contexts) and the role of Higher Educational Institutions (HEIs) in the diffusion of knowledge and know-how to companies. Together, the papers in this special volume provide insight into the promise of the S.PSS concept for understanding, advancing and accelerating sustainability.

Abstract: Abstract
Organizations in the current competitive business environment need to provide highly customized integrated solutions through dynamic collaborations within value networks. This need has been increasingly considered through different notions like Product Service System (PSS) and Service-Dominant (S-D) logic. These emerging notions shift a conventional supply chain towards a Service-Oriented Demand-Supply Chain (SODSC). The SODSC embraces the co-creation of a customer-centric value in the form of integrated solutions through a dynamic networked business. This paper, from a dynamic capabilities perspective, aims to move towards the operationalization of the characteristics of the SODSC. For this, we conduct a design science research approach that results in ten concrete dynamic capabilities enabling service-orientation. The validity of these concrete dynamic capabilities is evaluated on the basis of a case study in a mobility service ecosystem.

Abstract: Abstract
As a typical sustainable product-service system, the aero-engine overhaul service aims to recover the functionality to fulfil certain flight hours and thrust requirements. How to configure the overhaul service with various sub-services is a key issue in industry. In this paper, a use-oriented aero-engine overhaul service configuration approach is proposed with two methods: overhaul service configuration and part repair service configuration. The overhaul service configuration method decomposes the overhaul service into various sub-services and creates a hierarchical service tree model, taking the cost and energy consumption into consideration. Based on the sub-service filtering and selection rule, the bill of exchange service comes with the bill of discard service. The part repair service configuration method matches each part repair procedure service with a proper service provider. Some non-dominated bills of repair services are obtained by minimizing the repair service cost, finishing time deviation and energy consumption. Considering the multi-objective character of the overhaul service configuration problem, these two methods result in some Pareto solutions to fulfil the service requirements. Through implementing the approach as a prototype, a case study is shown to illustrate the use-oriented aero-engine overhaul service configuration approach and verify its feasibility. A bridge between the flight hours and thrust requirements and the overhaul service configuration results is built when the cost and energy consumption are minimized. The study contributes to the shift of aero-engine overhaul services from the add-on services to sustainable use-oriented product-service systems.

Abstract: Abstract
We propose a new generic design methodology for different types of PSS. Product – Service System (PSS) has received much attention recently from academia and industry because of its benefits. PSS can provide customers values and functionalities, as well as physical products, to fulfill economic, social and environmental goals.Many methodologies have been proposed for designing PSSs. Most of the existing methodologies are domain specific and were proposed to solve specific problems in certain projects. Some methodologies are generic but they provide neither guideline to practitioners and designers nor reflect the differences in various PSS types. As a generic approach to guide practitioners and designers in designing PSS effectively, the proposed methodology also takes into account user in-volvement, business model and organizational structure. The proposed methodology is demonstrated through design examples of different types of PSSs.

Abstract: Abstract
Equipment manufacturing firms nowadays increasingly provide Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) to improve productivity and service capacity, particularly in the current age of big data. Vast amounts of data are collected using database management systems from areas of product design, manufacturing, marketing, fault detection and maintenance service of IPS2. An urgent challenge in context of IPS2 is how to form reusable knowledge taking advantage of these data records for the sake of guiding subsequent maintenance decision-making. To handle this issue, data mining technology has been used in knowledge acquisition from different databases. However, it needs further investigation how to represent and reuse knowledge mining from these databases in IPS2 in relation to maintenance decision-making. Given this observation, this study first presents association rules in the form of Bayesian Networks that are mined from different databases of IPS2 and can be used to represent knowledge acquired. It then establishes a knowledge reuse framework based on Bayesian inference, which is used to support related decision-making in maintenance operations. Lastly, the proposed methodology is applied to a real-world case in an agricultural equipment manufacturing enterprise. The experimental results using real-time data sets illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology in handling maintenance decision-making associated with related fault phenomena.

Abstract: Abstract
Offering functional products (FP) are beginning to emerge as a growing trend within industrial firms driven by the desire to achieve economic performance and sustainable resource management goals. Nevertheless, our knowledge about how companies can adopt and implement FP has remained limited. In this study, we conduct a systematic literature review related to FP business models and tactical practices to advance the understanding regarding FP implementation. Based on the in-depth analysis of 48 articles, we develop a framework that proposes a link between FP business models and tactics. We further link FP business models to five operational level tactics, which can ensure the degree of their implementation and value generation. The identified tactical sets are contract, marketing, network, product design, and sustainability aspects.

Abstract: Abstract
In this paper, a hybrid PSS business model is considered for discussing the framework for value co-creation through customization and personalization. The framework consists of a business model, an engagement model which leads to value creation through customization, and a detailed service execution plan which offers opportunities for value co-creation through co-design, co-production and co-delivery, leading to personalization. The conventional approaches for PSS design do not explicitly address the aspect of customization and personalization through co-creation activities. The expected benefits for the provider and other stakeholders will be in terms of knowledge co-creation and ensuring enhanced customer experience through personalization.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainability has become one of the key factors for long-term business success. Recent research and practice show that business model innovation is a promising approach for improving sustainability in manufacturing firms. To date business models have been examined mostly from the perspectives of value proposition, value capture, value creation and delivery. There is a need for a more comprehensive understanding of value in order to promote sustainability. This paper proposes value uncaptured as a new perspective for sustainable business model innovation, and develops four forms of value uncaptured: value surplus, value absence, value missed and value destroyed. This paper also proposes a framework of using value uncaptured for sustainable business model innovation. This framework has been validated in case studies in six product-service systems firms with advanced manufacturing technologies. The empirical studies identify 26 main sources of value uncaptured throughout the product life cycle. The findings show that (a) the new perspective of value uncaptured can help manufacturing firms understand the negative aspects of their business models; (b) the four forms and 26 sources can assist firms in identifying value uncaptured in a structured way; and (c) the identified value uncaptured can trigger the discovery of new value opportunities which lead to new business models with higher sustainable value. This paper extends the existing studies on business models from the perspectives of value proposition, capture, creation and delivery, to value uncaptured. The proposed framework has helped firms identify value opportunities that trigger the innovation of sustainable business models. Therefore, this paper contributes to both theory and practice in the field of sustainable business models innovation.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to ongoing globalization, manufacturing companies are increasingly facing new challenges for which new business models are required. Nowadays, just selling products is not sufficient to provide customer value and thus to stay in business. In order to stay competitive, the integration of services can be a solution. Therefore, an approach is presented which integrates products and services into a new service-oriented business model. The development of the approach is based on an extensive literature research and emphasizes new aspects about business models. The example of a result-oriented business model for shape memory technology based on the results of qualitative interviews has been chosen to illustrate this approach.

Abstract: Abstract
Software systems have a growing importance in how services are delivered in the present-day. New methods and technologies are constantly introduced for realizing novel services in a wide range of industries. In this study, stakeholder involvement in the development of financial service software system is examined, as software has been integral to the delivery of financial services. Two projects are selected for their varying degrees of product and service content. Both teams used an adapted stakeholder identification framework developed for the healthcare industry to identify stakeholders and their involvement need in the development projects. The suitability of this framework for financial service software development, and the differences in stakeholders for the development of new software systems of dissimilar product-service mix are discussed in the paper. Four insights into the influence of product-service ratio in stakeholder involvement are gained in the perspectives of product quality, relationship management, product support by customer, and service delivery process.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays the relevance of Product-Service-Systems (PSS) is increasing. Providing customers with products and supporting services suiting the customer expectations becomes a key-factor for being successful in the market. Contemporarily, a huge amount of data such as usage-data from sensors or Product Embedded Information Devices as well as customer feedback from social media, forums or blogs is already available for manufacturers of PSS. These data sources provide valuable knowledge about the customer's usage of products and their expectations and complaints.

The successful exploitation of PUI - Product Usage Information (such as sensor data or user feedback) becomes a key success factor for future product developments as they aid the development of PSS directly deriving from costumer requirements. But an efficient use of such knowledge requires the setup of PUI related analysis, filters and the identification of dependencies between PUI and design parameters or component attributes. Thus, transferring the usage information to design requirements is currently the major challenge in the process of developing successful PSS.

Currently, there is a lack of research for a systematic transfer of PUI into product design requirements. A basic pre-condition for a knowledge transfer is a formal and neutral representation of both sides, usage data on the one hand and design parameters on the other. An approach for such a neutral representation is KbeML, which is specified as a formal extension of the established SysML standard, enabling a linkage of PUI and formalized KBE models.

This paper provides a case study regarding the connection of PUI and KBE models in the branch of White Goods. The information gathered from sensors embedded in washing machines will be considered in order to retrieve improved design requirements for next generation washing machines. In a first step the product structure of a washing machine will be represented in a formal and neutral manner by using KbeML. This way the washing machine is formally described in terms of an assembly structure, and broken down into subsystems and eventually individual parts, which are defined by their relevant core parameters.

In addition, the derived sensor data will be formalized as a SysML extension. The linkage between both sides (product structure data and PUI) can be achieved by mapping design parameters directly to parameters and values provided by sensors. To enable an analysis of these parameters the modelling language will provide statistical elements (e.g. median) allowing the extraction of critical values (information) from data streams.

This way a comprehensive modelling environment can be provided to corresponding stakeholders, supporting an effective and efficient application of usage data for the development of new or the improvement of existing PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Western manufacturing companies have lately started to rethink their approach to sustainability, mainly because of three different issues arising in the international context: the economic and financial crisis that has been slowing down the international marketsʼ growth, the necessity to increase competitiveness and the growing awareness of environmental and energy problems. This process has eventually led to the spread of servitization strategies causing the transformation of several equipment/components manufacturers into service providers, as well as to the creation of the concept of Product-Service Systems (PSS). Furthermore, a more focused attention to energy efficiency has arisen, with the dual objective of both containing costs and meeting international regulations. The intersection of these two development paths is the constant increase in the supply of energy services, which can be marketed together with devices, machines or energy vectors, creating a peculiar form of PSS. In the present work, a new classification is proposed to map different types of energy services, based on existing categorizations of PSS and enriching them with new parameters which are typical of energy services literature, such as the level of risks sharing. The main objective of this work is to highlight the tight connection between the provision of energy services and the concepts of PSS and sustainability, in order to provide a new general classification for energy services, discussed separately and fragmentary so far in literature.

Abstract: Abstract
Current market figures from Europe seem to indicate that recently introduced free-floating car sharing (FFCS) systems can be a breakthrough for the car sharing idea. Regardless of their success, FFCS systems face significant regional demand fluctuations, raising the need for vehicle relocations with novel requirements for the product–service system (PSS). This study aims to introduce an integrated decision support approach for cost and emission efficient vehicle relocation in FFCS based on real-world data from car2go. The proposed approach appears to be effective and have a significant potential to reduce costs and related emissions.

Abstract: Abstract
Facing the potential advantages and specific challenges of IPSS business model development we refer to a critical field for its succession: the hindering and supporting influence of managerial cognition. Related to microfoundations in dynamic capability research, we analyze for the development of IPSS how managerial cognitions influence a firms’ capability to realize new business model opportunities and to seize and reorganize its resources in order to take advantage from these opportunities. We apply the research on managerial cognition to the field of IPSS. Our empirical exploration is based on a qualitative case study analysis, comprising of interviews and cognitive mapping. We discover managers’ cognitions concerning new market opportunities, their perception of the necessity to change and their coping patterns for resource allocation. Our key finding is that IPSS are nor primarily considered as opportunities but rather threats with different strategies of coping mechanisms. There is a high consciousness for increasing sensemaking activities inside and outside the organization to adopt to new ways of value creation.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays Product-Service System (PSS) is a widespread trend consisting of adding services to the physical product in order to increase their market share, add value to their products, and create a new value proposition. Anyway, its application is still far from real industrial scenarios mainly due to difficulties in choosing the right partners, lack of collaboration among the partners, poor integration among the companies’ system platforms, and lack of knowledge about the available technologies. In such context, this paper presents an integrated methodology to support the PSS design process into a Virtual Enterprise (VE). It involves different stages, from idea management to global network definition. Furthermore, the business model items can be defined in parallel along the design process and benefit the design itself by supporting decision-making, according to a concurrent engineering approach.In order to demonstrate the benefits of the proposed approach, it has been applied to a real industrial use case represented by a Virtual Enterprise working in the field of household appliances. In particular, the method supported the PSS design by the definition of the PSS requirements and functions, as well as the selection of the global network partners. The as-is and to-be processes are described and compared. The use case represents a valid example of how a product-oriented manufacturing company can open its strategic vision creating a PSS Virtual Enterprise in a structured way.

Abstract: Abstract
Research in the field of industrial product service systems (IPS2) gives emphasis to the importance of leadership behavior in order to propel new business models. Nevertheless, there is only a little knowledge of what leadership pattern is crucial and makes a difference in comparison to production and service. In our paper we address leadership behaviors and empowerment in IPS2, trying to shed light on qualitative structural differences compared to product- and service-oriented work systems. We present data from an empirical survey among 172 engineers in Germany. The participants evaluated psychological and structural empowerment and perceived interactive leadership behaviors. These aspects built the basis for explorative factor analyses conducted for each work system separately. Comparative qualitative interpretations of the results show that there are three different patterns of leadership. In an IPS2 work system, leadership shows a contextualized configuration in which specific behaviors and empowerment components fuse within factors. The resulting pattern is compared to product- and service-oriented work systems. Detailed analyses display a pattern in IPS2-oriented work systems in which a combination of leadership behaviors and empowerment elements supporting strategic goal-orientation, transparency and positive sensemaking makes up the difference in comparison to both other work systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies in the manufacturing industry are shifting towards a more service-orientedbusiness model. One major challenge of this transformation is the information exchange between the different stages of the product-service-lifecycle. We extend the existing body of knowledge by conducting an empirical study in the German manufacturing industry, addressing the cause-effect relationship between 1) information gathering over the product-service-lifecycle, 2) data analytics 3) interpretation and use of new information and 4) distribution of new product related information and the impact of these four aspects on performance. The analysis reveals five different success factors with a significant impact on innovation and operation excellence. The implications from our research can help to develop new and more practical oriented Lifecycle-Product-Service-System approaches on the one hand. On the other hand it enables companies to focus on activities leading to higher service efficiency. Creating new stimuli will transform their existing business model to a more service-oriented one.

Abstract: Abstract
In order to successfully move “from products to solutions”, companies need to redesign their business model. Nevertheless, service oriented BMs in product-centric firms are under-investigated in the literature: very few works develop a scheme of analysis of such BMs. To provide a first step into closing this gap, we propose a new framework to describe service-oriented BMs, pointing out the main BM components and related PSS characteristics. Thus, the proposed framework aims to help companies to take into account the relevant elements that need to be designed to successfully implement a service-oriented BM and thus guide strategic decisions.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) fulfil specific customer needs in the industrial area due to the appropriate combination of product and service shares. Through the customer individual orientation of IPS2 the need for identification of suitable network partners for service delivery arises.

In this paper a method for the automated vendor selection for industrial service shares will be developed and evaluated. To achieve this goal, an investigation of possible service shares in the field of machine tools is necessary. Subsequently the parameters of the identified service shares and their potential values will be assigned.

The comparison of defined parameter values of the customer's query and all registered providers facilitates the automated mediation of appropriate providers. For IPS2, the presented approach holds several benefits compared to existing approaches. These include the ability of standardised comparison of the providers’ potential for service delivery and the efficient selection of appropriate providers under consideration of uncertainty.

Subsequently an application example of possible service shares for a customer request in the machine tool domain will be given. An outlook on further work and future potential will complete the paper.

Abstract: Abstract
A key capability for the future competitiveness of manufacturing companies is the development and delivery of integrated solutions. This comes along with a fundamental business transformation of the business model, structures, processes and behavior as well.However the majority of the initialized transformation efforts fail in the very beginning, because the factors and mechanisms of transformations are not fully understood. Although the concept of readiness is known as a crucial component and enabler for change processes, only few researchers have developed an assessment tool to measure companies’ change readiness for upcoming transformation projects. Therefore, this paper addresses this issue and introduces a concept to evaluate the readiness to transform towards solution business into a product-service system provider.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to the idea to offer costumer oriented products and services as Industrial product-service systems (IPS2) the interactions between provider and costumer become intensive. This is why IPS2 are mentioned as socio-technical systems. While having direct contact to the customer staff the provider employees must be able to fulfil cross-company interactions. The challenges of such an IPS2 relationship are to have the right set of competences and a useful amount of structures to handle intensive interactions and other organizational requirements. These challenges are classed with intellectual capital that characterizes intangible non-monetary values. The intellectual capital has an impact on the competitiveness of IPS2 and so there is a need for a method to assess intellectual capital for IPS2 relationships. In this paper an approach is shown to identify intellectual capital for IPS2 relationships during the IPS2 design. Also, the results of a first validation of the approach are presented that is done by a role-play- based case study.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) fulfil specific customer needs. This often implies the flexible reaction to changing requirements, impacting the adaption effort for the IPS2 provider. Additionally the modelling of individual business processes for the IPS2 delivery imposes a challenge to the provider. A great variety of process types, ranging from production to maintenance process, has to be covered in order to ensure a smooth and economically feasible IPS2 operation. Therefore, an approach for the modelling and automation of IPS2 delivery processes is of specific interest.

In this paper an IPS2 automation approach will be presented that allows the modelling and deployment of the specific business processes and enables the integration of service shares into the automation solution of the product share. The presented approach allows for an easy adaption of the product share configuration.

To achieve this goal, a workflow management system represents the backbone of all customer provider relationships that distributes the tasks and responsibilities to the IPS2 network partners according to the IPS2 business model. For machine-oriented service shares the workflow management system interacts with an implemented Java-based software agent system by means of web services.

Lastly, an application example of a prototypical IPS2 in the micro production domain will be given. The control system architecture and its implementation will be described and the application use case of manufacturing in the area of micro milling machine tools as a service share will be presented. An outlook of further work and future potential will complete the paper.

Product-Service Systems (PSS) were developed as more sustainable alternativesto traditional product sales, especially through better and more intensive use of materials. Some companies currently use this business model successfully,while others are still in the process of transforming to PSS. The change from providing a product to providinga service has proved to be rather difficultand actual sustainable benefits have been questioned.

The research described in this paper was part of the ServINNOV project.The initial idea was to find out if, and how, indicators could help in the moveto PSS. Indicators could give a clearer picture of thesituation andmonitor progress during the transition period. Indicators could also help companiesfocus on their core activities,and determine whether a PSS offering really helps them to become more sustainable. The study covers an overall view of sustainable indicators, with a focus on environmental issues.

The research for this paper was carried out throughboth theoretical and empirical studies. Empirical findings were obtained from interviews with three companies, all of them working with PSS on different levels. The results will guide transition to providemore sustainable PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturers increasingly engage in servitization and as a result offer services in combination with their products (i.e., product-service systems, PSS). However, while servitization in theory seems to be a promising strategy, in practice, the bundling of services with product offerings does not always result in the expected performance outcomes. In this paper, we propose a framework that helps manufacturers to overcome this servitization paradox. The underlying premise of our framework is the need to give primacy to the value customers derive from PSS. The framework builds on the idea that products and services differ with regard to the value that is created by the tangible elements and the interaction moments between manufacturers and customers; this is presented in a 2 × 2 matrix. Subsequently, this paper provides guidelines for identifying PSS that are effective in terms of value creation. First, the product and service elements of the PSS should have sufficient autonomous value to be sold separately on the market. Secondly, they should come from different quadrants of the 2 × 2 matrix. Lastly, the combination of product and service elements should create synergy. Through a survey among product and service developers and an experimental auction among customers we validate our ideas.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-service systems (PSS) can improve sustainability in terms of responsibility of providers and intensified customer-provider relationships. Therefore, a PSS approach has been applied on the distribution of solar home systems in rural areas of emerging countries to improve quality and increase confidence in this technology. However, many innovative projects fail at the piloting stage because of insufficient validation before implementation. Validation methods for PSS like an integrated gap model (e.g. identification of gaps between deliverables and customers expectations) or interdisciplinary design reviews show its limits on the interdependences between product and service development. A new approach to test PSS involves agent-based simulation models and is presented within this paper. Among system dynamics and discrete event simulation, an agent-based simulation is able to work with less quantitative data and a more detailed view on individual entities than the alternative approaches. Thus, it is possible to create more realistic simulation models to validate especially resource planning of a PSS. Agent-based simulation is used within the MEVIS (Micro Energy Supply Information System) project to model a network of solar home systems which are controlled by remote monitoring in order to improve service processes, e. g. maintenance and repair operations. The pilot test should be carried out efficiently by the preceding virtual validation in the form of a simulation, which is built in NetLogo, a tool that enables modeling of a multi-agent environment. Within this environment, communicating technical artifacts as well as different groups of actors are mapped as agents. As a result, diagrams of relevant parameters like the overall repair costs or the estimated customer's satisfaction are displayed and the resource planning is visually supported. This helps to push a PSS into a new market, where you have to deal with existing resources that must be used efficiently. The contributions in this paper provide the conception and an exemplary presentation of the simulation run.

Abstract: Abstract
Increasing environmental concerns together with the need for sustainable consumption and production gave birth to the concept of product service-system. This paperwork presents how the concept of product-service systems (PSS), also known as servitization, can increase performance within the value creation chain in the manufacturing environment by deployingits key features within smart manufacturing units to provide them withreconfigurabilityproperties. Highlights on how thekey feature of a product-service system can be used to enable the deployment of reconfigurability within smart manufacturing units towards achieving the concept of reconfigurable manufacturing systems are revealed in the first part of the paper.Considering the new economic models, the ever changing society needs and the effects of disruptive innovations, a business model for manufacturing environmentis further proposed. The business model deploys small scale reconfigurable manufacturing systems by means of smart manufacturing units, intelligent information management platforms, cloud computing services and Internet of Things. An experimental test bench is afterwards presentedin this context. Three similar manufacturing scenarios are considered and reproduced viaa mix ofsix smart manufacturing units and interfaces. The goal of these scenarios isto test the feasibility of servitization towards achieving reconfigurability of smart units.Several industrial equipment among which a dual-arm industrial robot, two electro-mechanical grippers, two electro-mechanical axes and two proximity sensors areintegrated with the embedded system to enable the deployment of PSS features. Also, how servitization is deployed within available smart units, their generic architecture and how they are interconnected is presented in the paper,together with advantages and constraints of the proposed experimental approach. The paper ends with conclusions, remarks regarding the experimental tests and further research directions.

Abstract: Abstract
The use of conventional service manuals is still common among service technicians during on-site support. If problems occur during the service process, service technicians have to analyze the situation and react accordingly. Problem analysis is subject to uncertainty in time, because the optimal course of action strongly depends on the current situation. Therefore, intelligent situation adapted support is needed to replace static guidance. This article describes a concept for the generation of interactive and situation adapted service instructions that are dynamically derived from a service process model.

After a brief introduction to on-site service support, the article describes in detail how service processes can be modelled by using the method of Integrated Enterprise Modeling (IEM). Subsequently, it shows how and in which phases automated test routines can be used to support the service process, followed by a critical discussion of possible information and communication technology (ICT) architectures to implement human-machine-interaction.

The concept includes an ICT-based approach for human-machine-interaction to trigger test routines on the machine to receive information about the condition of the machine. For Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2), the presented approach offers several benefits compared to existing approaches. These include the ability of tracking and influencing service processes as well as the simple adaption of new IPS2 modules in case of changing business models or customer requirements. The article concludes giving a specific scenario and an outlook on future research to be done.

Abstract: Abstract
By offering Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2) to their customers companies differentiate themselves from their competitors. However, companies are still facing the problem of a more complex and challenging development process which causes an increasing demand for new methods and tools for the integrated development of products and services. Although a generic PSS development process [4] has been developed within the scope of the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 29 (CRC TR29) to provide guidance for IPS2 development, a method for operationalizing this generic process and therefore supporting companies in planning integrated IPS2 development projects, is still missing. To overcome this shortcoming, a method for operationalizing the mentioned generic PSS development process was developed within the CRC TR29. This method describes a systematic approach for transferring the generic PSS development process into concrete project plans considering project specific boundary conditions within a project management software. Basis of the operationalization is the process-based PSS Development Project Management approach [3], which enables a straightforward, standardized and consequently a complete and high quality project plan. In this paper, the method for operationalizing IPS2 development process will be lilustrated by a test case of a crane manufacturer.

Abstract: Abstract
Most existing methods supporting the design of Product-Service System (PSS) support the ‘conceptual design’ phase at the higher levels of abstraction and the technical design phase strongly lacks of methodical support. This can be explained by the existing challenge of coupling products and services in designsince these two perspectives currently focus on different aspects and use specific models which appear as difficult to integrate. This paper proposes the design of a PSS for apneumatic energy delivery system. The design is based onthe combination and adaption of two existing methods from the product- and service- oriented design approaches for system engineering.Three levels of description are adopted: external and functional level, process level and structure level. Differentmodels are used to illustrate the levels. Their ability to reconcile the product- and service-oriented approaches is discussed since they provide a comprehensive view of the system in both perspectives. The resulting design process allows the identification of component specificationsand can be iterated at several levels of detail. This case-based design illustrates how the PSS design process can be supported at the technical phases.

Abstract: Abstract
Complex cyber-physical systems need particular attention both for physical architecture but also for service integration. In order to exploit the system but also to aid in controlling and driving it, one solution consists in elaborating functional models and to put them on board. During the lifecycle of the system, any person in charge of one given task or service has the possibility to get some help in driving the system and also to get some feedback with respect to reference models. The aim of the keynote is to present a global modeling approach and to illustrate the application of the propositions with ship building and controlling systems, both for the need of technical and functional people on board and also for the services dedicated to passengers.

Abstract: Abstract
Moving from selling goods to Product Service Systems (PSS) will promote coupling of environmental objectives with economic growth. However many difficulties hinder their implementation. Companies must rethink business models and replace value of exchange by value in use, involving long term relations. This paper proposes using ‘scenarios’ as a methodological tool to help support decisional processes when moving towards sustainable PSS. Transition scenarios formulate possible futures and provide a shared vision. They identify potential difficulties and help to formalize problems, reducing uncertainty for decision makers. This paper follows a twofold approach: theoretical and field studies in small companies. It concludes with initial propositions to structure scenario building in sustainable PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper proposes eight groups of twenty nine scoring criteria that can help designers and practitioners to compare and select an appropriate methodology for a certain problem in designing product service system (PSS). PSS has been researched for more than a decade and is now becoming more and more popular in academia as well as industry. Despite that fact, the adoption of PSS is still limited for its potential. One of the main reasons is that designing PSS itself is a challenge. Designers and developers face difficulties in choosing appropriate PSS design methodologies for their projects so that they can design effective PSS offerings. By proposing eight groups of twenty nine scoring criteria, this paper enables a “step by step” process to identify the most appropriate design methodology for a company’s PSS problem. An example is also introduced to illustrate the use of the proposed scoring criteria and provide a clear picture of how different design methodologies can be utilized at their best in terms of application.

Abstract: Abstract
It is well known that Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) are providing added value for both the customer and the provider. Within inno- vative IPS2 business models, risks that are traditionally related to the business processes of the customer are transferred to the provider by linking the revenue streams directly to the usage, performance or value of a system.

However the majority of production companies in Germany keep out of that business, despite the high potentials of IPS2 for gaining long last- ing sustainable competitive advantages. On the one hand side the transfer of risks is the key for new business models but on the other hand side it is one of the most challenging factors that hinder the successful implementation up to now. Therefore it is necessary to identify and manage both values and risks already within the early phase of IPS2 design. Due to the heterogeneity and fuzzy understanding of the design object and process itself, the role of uncertainties and risks in this surrounding is not clarified at all.

By literature-based research this paper is able to contribute to the understanding of uncertainty and risk management in IPS2 businesses and proposes a new and holistic approach for integrating the concept into the early design phase.

Abstract: The design and development of a Product–Service System (PSS) raises new issues since the service component introduces further requirements than traditional product engineering. Compared to physical products, services are generally under-designed and inefficiently developed. For this reason, approaches such as New Service Development, Service Design and Service Engineering have emerged during the years to support the design and development of service either as a system itself or as a constituting element of a Product–Service System. However, only Service Engineering investigates service design and development with a systematic perspective and with a seamless integration of product and service contents. The purpose of this paper is to provide a holistic conceptualisation and an up-to-date review of the literature on Service Engineering with a specific focus on its adoption in the PSS context. A critical analysis is also performed with the aim to define a research agenda and the most prominent key actions that could give directions for future research.

Abstract: Abstract
The adoption of digital technologies has been identified as crucial for manufacturers moving to service-based business [18,27,28]. However, it is not clear how technological improvement are central to develop key capabilities for business and service innovation [1]. This paper aims at filling this gap, focusing on the following aspects: 1) the key capabilities enabled by digital technologies to support servitization transformation; 2) the relationship between each specific value proposition and those capabilities. To ground our findings on extant research, we adopt the classification provided by [19], and we refer to three strategies, namely equipment suppliers, availability providers and performance providers.

Abstract: Abstract
Machine manufacturers who additionally offer services and also service providers are facing an increasingly keen competition. This leads to the fact that services have to be performed more effectively and efficiently. As a result, companies are progressively implementing Performance Measurement approaches in order to get an overview of the delivered performance. By the use of those approaches, the deliveryphase of services becomes more transparent, but conclusions are marginally drawn or improvements are not initialized from the data base. This is mainly caused by the fact that Performance Measurement approaches indeed offer a useful basis of decision making but is no appropriate tool for process improvements. In recent years, the Lean Management approach has been established in companies’production for process improvements. One determining tool is Value Stream Mapping, which gives an overview of processes and shows process improvements. This article represents an adaption of the Value Stream Mapping for services and shows how it can be integrated into a Performance Management.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial practitioners and scholars have argued that collaboration for the delivery of an industrial product-service system (IPS2) has become an increasingly important strategy for industrial firms. Further, the requirements for IPS2 implementation are different from traditional sales of manufactured products. Consequently, an understanding of uncertainty sources is therefore crucial to managing network complexity and allocating resource for uncertainty mitigation. Along these lines, a fuzzy analytical framework for evaluating supply chain uncertainty is proposed in this paper for prioritising sources of network uncertainty. A stainless steel manufacturing case company illustrates how the proposed framework of uncertainty measures and fuzzy-based techniques can be applied and can help researchers and practitioners to prioritise uncertainties from a practical point of view.

Abstract: In times of globalization and saturated markets, manufacturing companies are forced to find new possibilities of differentiation against competitors. Product-service systems (PSS) are a strategic approach that offers this possibility by integrating goods and services. The implementation of a PSS entails challenges for the resulting supply chain structure and the IT infrastructure supporting coordinated service offerings, such as conflicting goals and coordination in the integrated business processes. The service-oriented architecture (SOA) paradigm, based on loosely coupled components, provides rapid reconfiguration of business processes, rapid integration of services and goal definition through service level agreements. This paper presents a reference architecture based on SOA to support coordination and definition of goals in heterogeneous supply chains.

Abstract: Abstract
Today products are more and more substitutabledue to progress in information technology as well as globalization. New competitors, particularly from developing and emerging countries are putting established companies under pressure, due to lower production costs. In consequence, the prices and thus realizable profits for companies are decreasing. Focusing on the customer value can help to break this trend. In this way, the product understanding is changing. Besides offering products, offering services and combining both is getting more and more important. However, the product requirements are changing and may require new technologies. For small-to-medium-sized actuator applications shape memory alloy based actuator systems are a promising technology. In addition to the advantages in physical and mechanical properties, the integrated sensor function allows a simple condition monitoring and thus easy maintenance processes. Companies can generate new value for customers and are therefore able to improve their competitiveness. The consequence is that companies are offering new business models. For this reason, these actuators are ideal for industrial product-service systems. This paper illustrates the maintenance processes of shape memory based actuator systems using the integrated sensor function. Based on these maintenance processes andsuitable business models are designed as well as analyzed. As a result, recommendations for these actuator systems are provided.It is vital to introduce the relevant areas like shape memory alloy based actuator systems, industrial product service systems, maintenance and business models in the field of mechanical engineering first.

Abstract: Abstract
The motivation for the European research project ConTOOL (Controlling of resource efficiency throughout the life-cycle of tools) was the development of guidelines for the tool and die making industry on how to design and advertise resource efficient tools. One major obstacle is the acquisition costs of a resource efficient tool or die, which can be higher than the costs of an ordinary tool. Although, when looking at the total cost of ownership, the investment will be profitable due to the savings of energy and material, it will act as a deterrent for tool and die making companies. To overcome this burden a market positioning model was developed within ConTOOL. A market analysis of manufactures for tools and dies has been conducted in order to establish a basis for finding suitable market positioning strategies for resource efficient tools based on the particular competitive environment.

Abstract: Abstract
The rail infrastructure in Sweden, with its long lifetime, large amounts of materials used and traditional procurement, has escalating maintenance costs. What would occur if the infrastructure is instead procured as an Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO)? This paper discusses scenarios for increased resource efficiency and more value for the money spent by applying an IPSO perspective to rail infrastructure. The best option depends on the conditions at the construction site as well as how much the availability of the tracks is valued.

Abstract: Abstract
Studies on Product–Service Systems (PSS) are emerging as a growing body of literature driven by the desire to combine economic prosperity and sustainable resource management. However, knowledge about how companies can adopt and implement PSS has remained limited. In this study, a systematic literature review is conducted related to understanding implementation of PSS business models and five sets of tactical practices. Based on an in-depth analysis of 67 articles, it was found that PSS is increasing rapidly as a research field, which is spread across a variety of disciplines and research domains. More specifically, research findings were accumulated from the field to present a framework supporting the implementation of well-established categories of PSS business models, that is, product-oriented, use-oriented, and result-oriented business models. Each business model category is linked to five operational-level tactics that ensure the model can be implemented successfully and subsequently generates value. These tactical sets include 1) contracts, 2) marketing, 3) networks, 4) product and service design, and 5) sustainability operational practices. This study concludes by proposing suggestions for future research.

As early as the 1980's the telecom industry had moved to services using telecom products that could be provided within the offers (a gateway included in the offer) or by the customers themselves (a computer to access the web). However, although modern telecommunication systems are often considered as good support for Product Service Systems (PSS), telecom carriers hardly refer to PSS when establishing their own offers. Indeed it is not always easy to understand how modern telecom services, using personal mobile phones and other objects, really fit with PSS philosophy. This paper evaluates telecom offerings from a PSS standpoint. Current telecom offerings are compared with PSS characteristics found in literature. The results clarify the potentials of current telecom offerings in the PSS paradigm.

Abstract: Product-Service System (PSS) approaches and resulting benefits have been viewed mainly from a business world standpoint and in terms of economic and environmental dimensions of sustainability. This paper seeks to extend the application of PSS for community social-economic transformation and links it with Soft Systems Methodology (SSM), especially the Customer-Actor-Transformation-Worldview-Owner-Environment (CATWOE) method, to propose a model for synergistically sustainable community development. This approach recognises the diverse views and transformation goals of multiple stakeholders, fosters value co-creation in achieving desirable outcomes and uncovers synergies between system entities and various PSS elements. By analysing two examples of disadvantaged regional communities, the paper indicates how systems thinking and PSS can facilitate service innovation and opportunities for synergistic sustainability by transforming the local economy and improving services and social livelihoods.

Abstract: Abstract
Environmental issues due to emerging markets and rapid development of consumer goods’ consumption require a new model to design more sustainable products. While traditional eco-design methods (LCA, Check-lists, Guidelines, DfX tools…) are generally restricted to a local optimization of the product or to macro-rules for defining an environmental strategy, this article presents an eco-innovative method based on product upgradability which is the integration of functional enrichments on the product. Indeed, the integration of upgrades offers new opportunities for facilitating the dissemination of the remanufacturing approach, the dissemination of Product-Service Systems, or for increasing the lifetime of product.

This article presents an eco-innovative method based on upgradability consisting in: exploring the potential upgrades of modules - PMoL (SADT activity A4), the potential value network structures for upgradability - VaNS (A3) and the potential serviceable upgrades including eco-learning strategies - SMoL (A5). This method combines then the results PMoL, VaNS and SMoL to form promising Upgradable Modules Scenarios – UpMoS (A6), which are completed by the specification of an associated value network (A7) and the consolidation of eco-usage services and services offers (A8). The final result obtained, Upgradable systems concepts– UpSys are then assessed thanks to a multicriteria approach (A9) considering environmental, economic and user's and stakeholder's attractiveness criteria.

To summarize, this method is structured in two rounds. The first round (A3, A4, A5) aims to explore widely the possibilities offered by the upgradability avoiding the complexity of an approach dealing with several parameters simultaneously. The purpose of the second round (A6, A7, A8, A9) is to specify and assess Upgradable systems encompassing the overall results of the exploration. Before performing this work, relevant information needs to be collected for the project (market information, customer segments, technologies, stakeholders, environmental impacts of the current product, etc.) and acceptability domains of upgradable systems have to be analyzed (A1, A2).

This paper presents therefore this eco-innovative approach based on five founding principles and answering to the requirements identified in the literature for a good and effective eco-design method.

Abstract: Abstract
Numerous manufacturing companies have “servitized” their value propositions to address product commoditization and sustainability issues. Service—essentially different from a product—contributes to the fulfillment of customers’ unmet needs and increases the freedom of finding an environmentally more benign offering beyond simply offering the product. Informatics is a key to the design of services in manufacturing companies. Informatics facilitates the collection of various types of data from products and customers and enables the production and delivery of useful information for customers. This paper (1) proposes a conceptual framework for designing informatics-based services in manufacturing industries, (2) introduces a service design case study that the authors recently conducted with a major car manufacturer in Korea, and (3) suggests future research issues. This paper is expected to contribute to product–service integration in manufacturing companies in this information economy.

Abstract: Abstract
Through-life Engineering Services (TES) are essential in the manufacture and servicing of complex engineering products. TES improves support services by providing prognosis of run-to-failure and time-to-failure on-demand data for better decision making. The concept of Remaining Useful Life (RUL) is utilised to predict life-span of components (of a service system) with the purpose of minimising catastrophic failure events in both manufacturing and service sectors. The purpose of this paper is to identify failure mechanisms and emphasise the failure events prediction approaches that can effectively reduce uncertainties. It will demonstrate the classification of techniques used in RUL prediction for optimisation of products’ future use based on current products in-service with regards to predictability, availability and reliability. It presents a mapping of degradation mechanisms against techniques for knowledge acquisition with the objective of presenting to designers and manufacturers ways to improve the life-span of components.

Abstract: Abstract
In the manufacturing industry competitors are continuously struggling to differentiate from other companies in the market. Industrial Product- Service Systems (IPS2) offer this differentiation by representing a paradigm shift from traditional product selling and service offering to providing customer value. To support the IPS2 provider during the delivery and use phase of IPS2 an IPS2-Execution System (IPS2-ES) has been developed. The system is needed for planning, scheduling and organization of the required delivery processes and the partner network. In addition to that, a performance measurement method for IPS2 (IPS2-PMM) supports the IPS2 provider with an evaluation of the IPS2 delivery through key performance indicators (KPI). For the holistic agile scheduling and control for IPS2 delivery, an IPS2 control model has been developed. However, to add robustness for the IPS2 delivery, the IPS2-PMM has to be integrated into this model. In this paper, the IPS2 control model is extended to allow for an integration of the IPS2-PMM. Thus, the cascaded control loops are enriched by the generation of KPI for the evaluation of the IPS2 delivery.

Abstract: Abstract
The concept of improvisation is discussed in management literature as a promising mechanism and design principle for an organization's capacity for learning, adaptability and innovation. However, a specific form of improvisation for coping with the duality of production and service has not yet been applied to the servitization of manufacturing or PSS. This paper introduces a specific form of semi-structured improvisational learning related to PSS-oriented organizations. It introduces an organizational design principle of desired and accepted improvisational actions for highly individualized customer solutions. This semi-structured form of improvisational learning separates PSS from manufacturing-oriented organizations, where improvisation is rather a phenomenon of resistive actions that trigger undesired deviations. By emphasizing the increasing importance of improvisation and improvisational learning as a desirable and acceptable principle of action, it is argued that this rather paradigmatic shift demands specific capabilities from individual actors in PSS. These individual capabilities are summarized in this paper as learning-oriented capabilities that unfold a dynamic balance of generative and adaptive learning activities in PSS. As this specific pattern of individual capabilities is less cultivated in pure manufacturing, a game-based training and learning approach is introduced which is designed to accompany individual actors during the servitization process. The game-based learning scenario focuses on the development of individual improvisational capabilities as a mediating force in the dynamic triangle of customer, production and service. In conclusion, the literature review of this paper contributes to the scientific community by framing the servitization of manufacturing with the concept of improvisation as a coping strategy for the dynamics and ambiguity in PSS. Furthermore, a training and development approach is specified that aims at equipping individual actors with capabilities of improvisation and improvisational learning as prerequisites for the operation of highly individualized PSS. This training approach is also intended to be applicable for practitioners.

Abstract: Abstract
Different authors of the product-service bundle literature agree on the fact that business models are central to implement PSS successfully. However, most of the studies about PSS business models mention its importance but do not explore which content should compose such models. Furthermore, PSS business models are explored taking into account a partial view of business model dimensions. Finally, actions that lead to the creation of a new business for PSS or the adaptation of a current one are not distinguished. The goal of this study is to present a guideline to support the creation of PSS business models. Through systematic literature review and consulting with experts, the content of such models were developed. This content is organized in steps that encompass tasks, which must be performed in order to create a PSS business model. The method was already improved after application through a case study and currently is being utilized to generate a PSS business model for a bicycle sharing system. Final considerations include the weak and strong points of the method and further steps to enhance it.

Abstract: Abstract
While new organizational offerings, such as product-service systems (PSS), are evolving from adapted strategic decisions, the actors involved in the dynamic implementation of the product-service work system (PSWS) originate from different organizational backgrounds, contribute from various fields of expertise and are familiarized with different working cultures. This built-in heterogeneity is rooted in three distinct compositional sources of the PSWS and it can be classified into a separation, a variety and a disparity type. It gives floor to the successful co-creation of value but also contains numerous challenges as it demands the integration of product and service dominated logics within a heterogeneous, yet collaborative problem-solving working context. This paper aims at eliciting a set of individual competencies that helps workers cope with the demands of PSWS with specific interest in positive and negative effects of different types of built-in heterogeneity.Data presented result from a survey among PSS engineers across branches and organizational entities that were asked to answer a standardized questionnaire in 2012-2013 about competencies as behavioral ad-hoc regulations for unstandardized problem-solving environments. An explorative factor analysis results in a three-dimensional configuration: a) a set of coordinative practices is bundled for improved problem-solving mainly based on positive variety utilization,b) a set of optimistic information filtering activities is bundled to reduce complexity and to benefit from separation and variety, c) a set of reflective in-depth-learning practices supports a high aim at improving and builds on the utilization of variety and separation effects. Based on this configuration positive effects of PSWS built-in heterogeneity can be maximized while negative effects are minimized.

Abstract: Abstract
The evolution of capital goods companies towards a “service-oriented” business model is challenging and requires fundamental changes in the company. Main aims of this study, that is a part of a large research project, are to understand how business models of companies that operate in capital goods sector are configured and to identify different PSS types that can help companies to better understand the shifting toward a service-oriented business model. To achieve these results, we developed a framework, based on the Canvas model and carried out an exploratory survey among 95 European companies to understand the relevant issues that characterize business model configuration in servitization context.

Abstract: Abstract
Steel industry is one of the largest energy consumers in the manufacturing sector and covers a great share of the total energy consumptions in the world. As in recent years, energy efficiency has been a top priority for the European Commission, which set a reduction of 20% as a target for the energy consumption, so that great improvements in energy performances are required. Many improvements have already been introduced in the Electric Arc Furnace (EAF) process and additional progresses are very difficult to be achieved. Consequently, the main opportunity consists in the improvement of other system components, especially of the transformer's performance, as it is an expensive component with a strategic relevance for EAF operation. A more energy-efficient transformer can make a valuable contribution to European energy savings: lower energy losses substantially correspond to lower running costs. However, recent EAF transformers from different firms have become equally well performing, thus, the basis of the competition has been shifted from the single product offered to a customized solution that should fulfill specific customer needs. In other words, in order to obtain an advantage on the main competitors, some additional services, that are needed during the use phase of the product, are added. These extra services take into account the real energy losses obtained during the operation of the EAF and the maintenance activities. To perform the economical analysis of the solution, it is thus necessary to calculate the EAF transformer's life cycle cost (LCC) or total cost of ownership (TCO), over the life span of transformer. At the present, no works have been conducted on the EAF transformer which are exposed to more critical conditions than power/distribution transformers, and no real conditions have been considered even for other forms of transformer. In addition, the only aspects that have been taken into account in the existing transformer's LCC were the purchasing price and a share of the total relevant costs of losses (no-load and load losses). Thus, the aim of the present work consists in the evaluation of a solution consisting of a tangible product (EAF transformer) and intangible services (e.g. maintenance activities, operational consultancy) that best satisfy the EAF operations’ requirements, in order to simultaneously enhance competitiveness and support sustainability. Moreover, the other relevant contribution is the integration of maintenance aspects and failure risk, as design decisions affect also transformer's reliability and related maintenance activities.

Abstract: Abstract
During the last years, several frameworks for developing PSSs arose, which vary in focus. Examples of their focuses are engineering processes, technology, knowledge engineering, services or tangible products. However, just a few frameworks concentrate on the market or, specifically, the customer. As the customer is the key success factor of any product, we have developed a framework for designing PSSs by adapting an existing technology-centered framework. Our framework describes the perspective of increasing customer acceptance using PSS. Increasing customer acceptance means to reduce the effects and influences of customer barriers, e.g. unnecessary high costs of purchase or a lack of trust in the product's reliability. The model consists of three layers and the strategy space. The layers are the customer layer, the barriers layer and the solution layer. The customer layer describes the customers and the target groups of customers, who the PSS aims at. The barriers layer includes all customer barriers that are to be reduced by the PSS. The solution layer describes the PSS and its components; tangible elements, intangible elements and the infrastructure for connecting all elements. This layer shows how the PSS is realized to reduce the customer barriers of the focused target group. As other goals and influences affect the design of a PSS, the strategy includes external factors. Those external factors are generated by the company itself (e.g. other departments, product portfolio) or by external stakeholders or sources (e.g. suppliers, laws). Our model helps designers to understand the proceeding to design a PSS for increasing customer acceptance by reducing customer barriers.

Focusing on the importance of considering value-in-context, this research aims to formalize how the concept of context should be handled in Product-Service Systems (PSS) design.In PSS design, it is important to combine products and services appropriately based on customer requirements. For the requirementsanalysis, specific situations in product useshould be clarified considering customer context. However, there is no method to extract elements of customer context in existing PSS design methodologies. This paper proposes a framework whichclassifies viewpoints for extracting the elements of context. Based on the framework, a context-based requirements analysis process is also proposed.

Abstract: Abstract
Service elements are added and enhanced to make manufacturing companies more innovativeand grow revenue. The servitization process could take many different routes reflecting variousproperties of the manufacturing firm and its business contexts. Product-service systems designmethod developed at Sungkyunkwan Universty, Service Design Institute, has been applied to asmall furniture manufacturing company to demonstrate the utility of the method and to deviseimprovements. First, the business context of the company has been analyzed mainly in threeaspects of business capacity, internal capacity and customer base. Then, requirements of thecompany's clients and their customers have been obtained. Next, a co-creative designworkshop with the design team and the company team has been conducted to identify valuesfrom economical, ecological and experienceaspects. The activity of the workshop is todevelop initial service concepts to drive those key values. The diverse positioning of those serviceconcepts on the scale of service supporting product and service support customer is then developedto plan servitization phases. The specific service concepts are about company-customerrelationship building as well as customization and personalization in this case. Initial service conceptsare detailed with service blueprint so that prototyping and customer experience evaluation can bedone. Business models in different servitization phases are designed. Further prototyping andcustomer experience evaluation has been done with business strategy improvements. In this talk,the specific and real process of this servitization will be described with discussion on theimprovement of the method and the enhancement of the business.

Abstract: Abstract
Through the provision of integrated products and services, solution providers have more to gain than solely profit. This paper introduces the concept of provider value, which is novel in the area of integrated products and services. Further, a method is proposed (ProVa) to identify and evaluate the provider value of an integrated product service offering (IPSO) during the development process. ProVa allows for an assessment in terms of monetary value, but also with respect to other categories such as information and customer relations. In addition, aspects such as uncertainty and experience curve effects are considered.The functionality of ProVa is shown by application to a case in IPSO design.

Abstract: Abstract
In the light of the prevailing trend towards product-service systems (PSSs), this paper focuses on the measurement of PSS functional performance. As a ‘dynamic’ system wherein various stakeholders achieve functional performance through long-term relationships in a complex value network, PSS functional performance requires a dynamic approach for measuring its effectiveness, an approach that is missing in the literature. This study aims to fill that void. Firstly, we address the concept of functional dynamics as a distinctive measure of PSS functionality with regard to functional performance and propose a five-phase analytic scheme of functional dynamics. Then, to measure the functional dynamics of PSS using the analytic scheme, a four-step procedure based on the system dynamics is suggested. As a representative method for measuring the long-term dynamics of a complex system, system dynamics is effectively employed to measure PSS’s functional dynamics comprehensively. To illustrate the proposed approach, a case study of a u-healthcare system is presented.

Abstract: Abstract
The emerging offerings referred to as Product-Service-Systems (PSS) require high adaptability of products to permanently changing customer requirements and operation conditions to ensure the contractually guaranteed performance.Thus the product lifecycle is characterized by several engineering changes (EC) made throughout, especially within the operation phase. Those changes have different triggers so that each change process is unique. EC process managers who are responsible for planning and execution of EC must take into account the particularities of each EC related to its permanently changing boundary conditions. Especially the heterogeneity and dynamic of PSS requires a prompt reaction to unforeseeable events and consequently adaptation of the EC process in real-time. Traditional Engineering Change processing approaches provide pre-defined engineering change processes, which a priori define the required workflows and cannot by adapted in real-time. The required adaptability of EC processes requires a distinction between what must be achieved representing the process goals of an EC. And the way how those goals should be achieved depending on the boundary condition of the EC process which represents the process activities. Hence, the paper in hand presents a knowledge-based assistant that supports EC process managers by planning, and execution of such goal-oriented adaptive EC processes. The assistant provides a graphical tool that supports the one hand the modeling and knowledge-based planning of goal-oriented EC process and their real-time execution. On the other hand, it provides an intuitive and knowledge-based information environment based on the analysis of a developed EC ontology that contains the different elements involved within the EC process and their complex and dynamic relationships.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the major challenges facing today's manufacturing industry is to differentiate from competition in a highly globalized world. As a consequence to the increasing competitive pressure, many companies transform their product centered business models towards service based business models to differentiate from competition. However, the transformation is often underestimated regarding its complexity and its management challenges to behavioral change. As a consequence lots of transformation initiatives fail. Besides difficulties in structuring the magnitude of changes in processes and structures, many transformation managers do not perceive the risk of employee resistance against changes, which is one of the key factors causing the failure of transformation. The objective of this paper is to enhance the existing body of research on manufacturer's organizational transformation towards Product-Service Systems. More detailed, the objective is to develop new knowledge to support the management during the decision-making process in the way how and by means of which instruments the change of behavior can be supported when transforming from a manufacturer to a solution.

We developed a reference framework which structures and defines the relevant dimensions of behavioral change. The identification and validation of the success factors build the second component of our research. We conducted an empirical investigation in the German manufacturing industry and got 79 data sets. Structural equation modelling was applied for the analyses and the validation of the hypotheses. By this analysis we linked management practice with employee behavior and transformational success variables. On the basis of the gained insights decisions can be made concerning the successful transformation from manufacturer to a solution-oriented service provider.

Abstract: Abstract
For manufacturing companies venturing the first steps on the Servitization roadmap, it may be difficult to imagine how an integrated approach of Product and Service elements could support the strategic goals efficiently. If Service tasks, roles, units and organizational structure are still developing and emerging from the Product business activities, the design of Product-Service cooperation as well is promising, as the way is unclear. For these companies, it seems to be important to understand their current status of Product-Service cooperation at first, before starting to design integration activities.

Therefore, this paper presents a framework which is designed to help companies identify their current status – and strategic objectives later on – at two dimensions: a) the Structural Focus of Product and Service business within the company, and b) the Cooperation Activities which are undertaken by Product and Service representatives. By the means of a case study in the Italian luxury textile sector, a first validation of the model is conducted, assessing the static and dynamic characteristics of Product and Service business with involvement of an Italian textile company.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial procurement is exposed to an increased service-oriented supplier market. However, industrial e-marketplaces for product-services that are accepted by buying experts are rare. Possible buyer benefits of e-markets such as access to a wider range of markets, accumulation of required information, and increase of market transparency cannot be utilized. Currently, product-services are at best traded within closed silos that offer mainly manual search and comparison capabilities through a web storefront. A lack of existing “generic” industry-sector-specific concepts for service description is a main problem that the potential of e-commerce is not utilized for product-services. This article analyzes the requirements for service representation at e-markets regarding the manufacturing domain. State-of-the-art concepts of business service description are considered at the beginning of this research. Because of the heterogeneity of product-services, a case study was conducted in order to identify relevant product-services in the manufacturing domain. In order to study a real case scenario, a “first-tier supplier” in the automotive industry was used in this research study. This company is specialized in systems engineering and systems serial assembly. Typical product-services of this company source are manufactured products needed for serial production, for example, casting, milling, turning, or injecting molding parts, alongside a wide range of services. Investigating the professional purchasing department was necessary to analyze the requirements in service description throughout the complete buying process, commencing with the conceptual product design stage until the serial product delivery.

Abstract: Abstract
Maintenance service is the most important part in industrial product-service system (iPSS). To enhance the proactiveness of maintenance service, the failure time of product need to be predicted. This study provides insight into how the maintenance time can be predicted accurately for the service decision-making of IPSS based on the historical failure time data, avoiding the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring. An improved grey prediction model is introduced to obtain a predictive interval of maintenance service time which is used as basis for making a decision of proactive maintenance service. The method is applied in an instance of maintenance service for agricultural machinery. In three examples of different types of agricultural machinery, the predicted intervals of maintenance time are given and the fitted values have high accordance with the real ones. The result shows that this approach can be used effectively to predict production failure time. Moreover, the output results of this approach can provide the necessary support to make a decision for proactive maintenance service without the dependence on mechanical condition monitoring in a reliable way.

Abstract: Abstract
Successful business is increasingly about understanding the challenges and opportunities linked to society's transition towards sustainability and, e.g., being able to innovate, design and build business models that are functional in this context. However, current business model innovation and design generally fails to sufficiently embrace the sustainability dimension. Typically, the business case of sustainability is not understood profoundly enough; the planning horizon and system scope are insufficient; the competence to bring together people into systematic ventures towards sustainable business is too low. A unifying framework for sustainability analyses, planning, cross-disciplinary and cross-sector cooperation, and cohesive use of the myriad sustainability tools, methods and concepts has been developed: the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD). Similarly, a generic approach to business model design has been put forward: the Business Model Canvas (BMC). In this paper we explore how the FSSD could inform business model innovation and design by combining it with the BMC and supplementary tools, methods and concepts such as creativity techniques, value network mapping, life-cycle assessment, and product-service systems. The results show that the FSSD-BMC combination can support business model innovation and design for strategic sustainable development, as well as strengthen each supplementary tool, method and concept in its own primary purpose. We apply the combined approach, for the purpose of initial testing and presentation, to a real case of business model evolution. Based on our findings we propose a new approach to business model innovation and design for strategic sustainable development. The new approach facilitates, e.g., business scalability and risk avoidance and clarifies the interplay between classical business model development and strategic sustainability thinking. The new approach highlights the opportunity for novel business model design for future sustainable success.

Abstract: The paper explores the evolution of Design for Sustainability (DfS). Following a quasi-chronological pattern, our exploration provides an overview of the DfS field, categorising the design approaches developed in the past decades under four innovation levels: Product, Product-Service System, Spatio-Social and Socio-Technical System. As a result, we propose an evolutionary framework and map the reviewed DfS approaches onto this framework. The proposed framework synthesizes the evolution of the DfS field, showing how it has progressively expanded from a technical and product-centric focus towards large scale system level changes in which sustainability is understood as a socio-technical challenge. The framework also shows how the various DfS approaches contribute to particular sustainability aspects and visualises linkages, overlaps and complementarities between these approaches.

Abstract: Abstract
The interest for the product-service system (PSS) approach has increased substantially in the last decade. New born research fields such as the PSS require the understanding of their knowledge structure as well as of their evolving structure of research collaborations. In this sense, the research field is better explained, supporting the alignment among new studies and an improved performance in the knowledge building. There are already papers in the literature that addressed the state-of-the-art in PSS, providing important guidance. However, they have not still focused on quantitative metrics, which are capable of providing a supplementary perspective. Therefore, this study aims at developing a bibliometric analysis of the PSS research field, looking for its current situation and possible evolution in terms of knowledge creation, collaboration networks and geographical distribution. A sample of 118 PSS papers published from 2002 to 2013 was collected in the Web of Science Database. Vantage Point, UCINET and NetDraw software was used to perform the bibliometric analysis. The results show a huge increase of the research field after 2011 and a balanced distribution of papers among authors. Europe and Asia are assigned to the majority of studies, showing strong collaboration networks among their institutions. Furthermore, journals with the highest number of PSS papers and the most cited papers are identified as well as the predominant knowledge topics addressed within the period. This study provides a holistic view of the PSS research field. It provides metrics regarding publications, which are useful for new entrants to identify the state-of-the-art and to understand their possible contributions to the research field. In addition, the investigation of collaboration networks shows the research groups in activity, highlighting opportunities for new collaborations and supporting the development of scientific policies. Finally, this study adopts quantitative metrics that can be reused for other studies in the future to update the status of the PSS research field or to perform similar analysis for other fields.

Abstract: Abstract
Customers’ individual preferences are calling for greater variety of firms’ offerings. Faced with this situation, firms endeavour to meet customer requirements while reducing their costs and impact on the environment to remain competitive. The attainment of these goals entails various issues that must be addressed including multiple performance drivers and criteria relating to environmental and economic sustainability and variety. Accordingly, trade-offs must be defined and balanced among such heterogeneous criteria to facilitate the decision-making process on a variety of levels regarding environmental and economic sustainability. These trade-offs should involve decision makers to reflect the firm's priorities and consider its business field. This paper proposes an approach supporting the decision-making process on offering variety to the market while considering environmental and economic sustainability criteria. More specifically, the approach uses economic and environmental performance indicators and inputs from decision makers to determine the variety of the offering to meet a given demand. The paper highlights the impact of variety steering on environmental and economic sustainability indicators.

Abstract: Abstract
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a state-of-the-art method for conducting environmental assessments of systems, whether these consist of goods or services, or a combination of the two. However, current LCA guidelines focus on assessing tangible products and lack specific attention to more complex systems, such as Product/Service-Systems (PSS), which also consist of intangible elements. PSS imply a shift in business paradigm from selling specific products to delivering a function, through a mix of products and services, thereby incentivising resource efficiency as well as user satisfaction. Despite their potential to reduce environmental impacts, PSS are not by default more environmentally benign compared to conventional systems, and quantifications of their environmental performance are called for. This paper contributes by showing that specific challenges need to be addressed when using LCA to evaluate the environmental performance of PSS. We identify a set of PSS characteristics that can challenge an LCA study. Three relevant scopes are distinguished, where LCA may be applied: (1) evaluating options within the PSS itself; (2) comparing a PSS with an alternative; and (3) modelling the actual contextual changes caused by the PSS. We derive three pronounced challenges when conducting LCA within the three scopes: (i) identifying and defining the reference system; (ii) defining the functional unit; and (iii) setting system boundaries. We elaborate on how these challenges are discussed in current literature. Recommended future work includes developing adapted guidelines and further empirical case studies that quantify the environmental changes and impacts caused by introducing PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
The increasing presence of telecommunication offerings on the market poses the question of material and energy consumption. One way to reduce these impacts would be to shift their business model to Product-Service Systems (PSS). To study this prospective, the paper focuses on three telecom offerings provided by a French telecom carrierand analyses how close they are to PSS. The first is a classical telecom business offering dedicated to small and medium sized enterprises. The second is dedicated to the school market, providing a dematerialized solution to help the different actors to interact and share information. The third concerns retirement homes and medical establishments. It helps the medical staff to improve the safety of disabled persons.Evaluation of the caseshighlights the key parameters that guide transition to PSS. The paper shows how the method can be used to understand each offer individually and also to establish priorities between the offers for introducing PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
For many years the market leadership was driven by offering better price on more product functions and services. The world is currently shifting towards social responsibility thinking. This changes the market behaviour, and leads to more innovations, such as designing new product/service/system using re-usable parts, new electric motor concepts, or inventing new chemical production procedures generating less waste, and many more opportunities.

This paper introduces a research valorisation activity that aims at developing a program of training and coaching to prepare students and industry partners to this emerging innovation wave. The most outstanding particularity of this program is that it combines management and engineering aspects of sustainability in a form that empowers trainees to deploy sustainable approaches in practice. The particular target group of design engineers get equipped with fundamentally important sustainability knowledge enabling them to include sustainability considerations in their products and systems design. Eco-design is positioned as a key lever towards achieving sustainable product-service systems.

Abstract: The growing demand for innovative services forces traditional product-oriented companies to perceive the potentials and strategic importance of services. Innovative services enable these companies to ensure their market positions and to achieve economical success. Due to this, it becomes necessary to systemize service design, development and management processes as well as to tightly integrate products and services. In this paper, methods and important fields of action regarding the systematization of services – service engineering (SE) – as well as the integration of products and services – industrial product-service systems (PSS) – are presented.

The paper addresses which customer values, related to sustainable management of operation for Functional Products, are of interest during manufacturing companies’ marketing and sales processes. Based on an empirical study covering five manufacturing companies, a set of customer values, which are categorized using Hill's [28] framework in order to understand whether they are important and why,is proposed. The analysis has generated a set of twenty-three potential values, whereof nine are considered as specific for contexts embodying Functional Products.Thus, the findings identify critical values to considerprior to, andwhen, selling Functional Products. Further, the results have important implications for the design and development of Functional Products in light of ongoing transformations within the manufacturing industry.

Abstract: Abstract
A company's economic survivability depends on the trust customers have into the company and its offered solutions. Consequently a company tries to act as a trustworthiness business partner. A difficult task, when customers cannot check the outcome and quality of an offered solution. Especially for Product Service Systems (PSS), the service part represents such an intangible performance, which cannot be used and verified by customers before consumption. Consequently, customers must trust a company's promised performance quality before they can experience the service. Service production always involves the customer into the service provision process, as the value is co-created. That is why, the service provider's performance and thus its service production costs rely trusting a customer's input. As trust plays such an important role we integrate it into service costing. In our work we present and evaluate a risk-based costing approach for PSS. The benefit of our cost model is to include risk factors associated with the trustworthiness of customer input. Our contribution to service science is the computation of service costs by the extension of standard Time-Driven Activity-Based Costing (TDABC) including the expected loss due to customer input. In our work we demonstrate the successful inclusion of trust-based risk factors into service costing to improve service cost management in the context of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
In our paper, we focus on the characteristics of the organizational transformation process that integrates the product and the service paradigm to achieve a Product-Service System (PSS). Due to the outcome of our own research activities and recent literature about the servitization of manufacturing, the transformation towards PSS is considered as an organizational learning and renewal process that has special demands for collective learning and knowledge-sharing activities. These demands are regarded as particularly crucial to manage the integration of the product and service paradigm. For the design of a specific learning scenario that prepares individuals for the demands of PSS work environments and the challenges along this organizational development process, we refer to the 4I Framework of organizational learning as a conceptual background to frame the transformation towards PSS within a context-rich learning environment. The design of the PSS-related learning scenario addresses the challenges of the organizational transformation process towards PSS on the individual, group and organizational level. The role of participants as individual actors in this learning scenario is determined by a PSS-specific 4I Framework as a holistic approach in which learners have to work out strategies to overcome typical barriers of a PSS-related organizational transformation process. The PSS- related learning environment builds on a business game scenario which provides us with the opportunity to address the ambiguity and the dynamic character of the transformation process towards PSS. Furthermore, we outline the advantages of a game-oriented community approach that supports individual learners to understand how to integrate the product and the service paradigm collectively in a fictitious but reality analogous organizational environment.

Abstract: Abstract
An Industrial Product-Service System (IPS2) is characterized by a high integration of product and service shares. This implies that the providing company develops an IPS2 consisting of product share, e.g. a highly complex precision machine tool, and service share to increase customer value, strengthen the relationship between customer and provider and finally generate profit. However, providing an IPS2 involves a high degree of organizational effort. The operation of an IPS2 includes the detection of service demands, strategic and operative scheduling of processes and resources, coordination of service and supply network partners and the monitored delivery of service processes.

In this paper, an IPS2 Control Architecture for the operation phase is proposed. Then, the function and application area of two software systems, the IPS2-Execution System and the IPS2-Control System, are described and their interaction within the proposed architecture is outlined. Furthermore, the detailed interaction process is illustrated in an application scenario in order to demonstrate the advantages and necessity of both systems and their interdependency. Also, an outlook on further research is given.

Abstract: Abstract
Since the 1970s, marketing and innovation management communities have been investigating how to incorporate customer-desired functions into new product and service designs. These wide-ranging enquiries have shed light on the impact of lead-user engagement in new product development, demonstrated ways to examine service production and delivery, such as the use of ‘line of visibility’ in service blueprints and the modelling of ‘service encounters’, and have created new terms such as ‘value co-creation’. Despite these efforts, recent reviews have identified the lack of an holistic approach to new product-service system (PSS) development. This deficiency needs to be rectified, especially for complex PSS developments in regulated industries such as healthcare, as often there are multiple stakeholders posing conflicting priorities to the development team.

This paper describes a novel PSS characterisation approach that supports the early-stage new PSS development process. The approach is originated from eleven healthcare case studies, involving twenty-five new products, services and PSSs. Following the methodology of action research, further cases are selected for the application of the approach to a new product, service or PSS concept in facilitated workshops. Initial implications of employing this approach in three cases are discussed in this paper.

Abstract: Informatics related to point-of-care devices denotes the ability to translate stand-alone biological data into meaningful information that can be interpreted to enable and support users in taking the most appropriate steps to aid in managing their health. This paper considers small point-of-care devices used outside healthcare environments, and presents glucometers as an example. The paper seeks to evaluate the current level of servitization of point-of-care testing devices and considers whether they are, or could form, the product-core of a product-service system. The type of product-service system, its informatics requirements, and the services such a system could provide are also considered.

Abstract: Abstract
Product- and service-design methods traditionally focus on different aspects and use specific models which are difficult to integrate. This paper proposes a PSS “multi-views” modelling framework for supporting integrated PSS design. By coupling models currently used by product and service engineers, the proposed framework should provide a communication support for these actors during PSS design. The “multi-views” perspective should allow them to detail the design of the PSS components until the most technical phases while it also should ensure integration of these components through a shared perspective on the system modelling.

Abstract: Abstract
The sustainable product-service system (SPSS) concept highlights that achieving sustainability requires changes in both ‘production’ and ‘consumption’. Nevertheless, attention has focused mainly on ‘production’. This paper enriches the SPSS approach with insights from the sociology of consumption and practice theory to provide a deeper understanding of the use of products and services in daily life contexts. The paper advances three key insights related to: a) the internal dynamics of user practices, b) the strength of linkages of practice elements (loose and tight coupling), c) external linkages to other practices. These insights are mobilised to provide a deeper understanding of the uptake and diffusion of innovations such as SPSS. The insights are illustrated with two cases in which interventions designed to stimulate diffusion have had differential success: energy efficient light bulbs and low temperature laundry. Implications for understanding the diffusion of SPSS are discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
Over the last decade, Product-Service System (PSS) has been established as a prominent business model which promises sustainability for both customers and organizations. A great amount of literature work has been devoted to PSS issues, but there is fairly limited published work on integrated and easily applicable evaluation methodologies for PSS design, as well as lack of Lean PSS approaches. Contributing to these directions, the present work introduces a conceptual methodology for the evaluation and improvement of the PSS design procedure using Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Lean rules respectively, applied throughout all stages of PSS design lifecycle. The methodology contains two phases: i) PSS design evaluation, and ii) Lean PSS design assistance. According to the evaluation phase, a certain appropriate set of KPIs is selected and suggested to the PSS designer via a context sensitivity analysis (CSA) tool through a pool of 170 KPIs, which have been identified after intensive literature survey, and systematically classified into four main categories: Design, Manufacturing, Customer, and Environmental. From the collected and classified KPIs, a successive grouping is carried out of those KPIs that contribute to the Sustainability of the designed PSS offering. During the phase of Lean design assistance, Lean Rules are selected using CSA, and suggested to the designer at all design steps to ensure the minimization of wasteful activities. Enabler for the context awareness is the availability of feedback gathered from the manufacturing, shop-floor experts and the different types of Customers (Business or final-product Customers), as well as the PSS lifecycle stages which the designer treats. An ontology knowledge model for KPIs and Lean rules is proposed to support the CSA. The methodology is discussed in a case study of the PSS design from a mould-making industry.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper explores the implications of combining an Integrated Product and Services Offering (IPSO) (also known as PSS) with Industrial Symbiosis (IS) in order to facilitate the increased utilization of Excess Heat (EH). To do so, five different EH cases originating from an IS perspective have been investigated. Based on an IPSO-focused literature review, those five EH cases are analyzed to identify potential pros and cons, if an IPSO perspective is applied, in order to further improve EH utilization.

The results indicate that applying the IPSO concept, in combination with IS, has the potential to facilitate and improve EH utilization. However, also of importance is having a clear and well-formulated business agreement, as well as mutual trust and a well-functioning dialogue between the parties involved in the EH supply collaboration.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing companies are currently competing for the identification of innovative value propositions to position themselves in the market. This led to a shift from providing traditional transaction-based and product-centric offerings towards the provision of integrated solutions to their customers. In this context, Service Engineering, the discipline concerned with the systematic development and design of service and product-services, is gaining particular interest. This paper provides a contribution in this field proposing a SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) which aims to support servitizing companies in: (i) (re)engineering of service and product-services offering, (ii) defining the most suitable and complete service and/or solution for customers, and (iii) balancing the excellence in the customer satisfaction and the efficiency and productivity in the service provision process.

Abstract: Abstract
In manufacturing, Product-Service Systems (PSS) that create value by coupling a physical product and a service have been attracting attention. According to this background, many researchers have proposed PSS development methods that provide guidance on HOW TO realize a PSS. However, difficulties still remain with regard to constructing an organization for PSS development; i.e., answering the question, WHO realizes a PSS? In order to clarify problems with regard to constructing the organization, this paper proposes an organizational framework for PSS development. Based on this framework, this paper points outsome research challenges with regard to constructing the organization for PSS development, and then, introducing the PSS development methods that can address these challenges.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper proposes steps of conceptual service design by assimilation of service modeling methods into conventional design practices of ICT systems integrators. The service models are simplified into four forms: persona-scenario, requirement-function-resource tree, Actors’ Map, and service blueprint. The input and output data of each model are formalized with design principles, enabling data chain between the models. The relationships between the data of design deliverables, such as plan, functional design, and detailed design documents, are also defined clearly in accordance with their design procedures. As the results, roles for tasks are clarified, and tasks and deliverables are systematized into seven design steps. The steps help to change the mindset of system integrators from product-oriented to service-oriented and assist servitize their business.

Abstract: Abstract
Servitization of manufacturing is getting more importance in our global economy due to the need of manufacturing companies to maintain their sustainability, promoting this way a more long term relation with their customers, and innovating and supplying added value with their products. Therefore, manufacturing companies are challenged to move into a paradigm shift that is to go from considering independently products and services and start to consider them integrated. To integrate services, in their core products, and to support this, process organizational changes are required, and methodologies that integrate the product and services development processes. An effective integration of these processes creates a potential for product-service innovation, that being exploited, contribute to increase competitiveness and to ensure sustainable businesses. In this article, we propose a new methodology for the development of product-service systems (PSS) that promotes the execution of processes for designing products and services, as a parallel sequence of activities, which leads to a consistent product-service development. The proposed methodology contributes for a clear understanding about the processes to be used in product-service design and development, the required organizational changes, and the integration of product-service design with business model definition.

Abstract: Abstract
Growth of global sales of new trucks in emerging economies is substantial however, in China the growth of sales is expected to be only 1% for 2014–2024. The limited sales growth forecast and an intense market competition make it imperative for truck manufacturers in China to diversify their revenue earnings through service-based business models for the Chinese market. Typically, Chinese service based business models need to be sustainable by considering environmental and social factors in the manufacturer’s business model. This paper reviews existing product–service systems (PSS) and service-based business models in the automotive sector to identify how truck manufacturers could reorient their current business model with respect to the Chinese context to enhance customer satisfaction, profitability and sustainability. The analysis indicates that most of the studies in the automotive sector have focused on product-oriented or use-oriented business models with respect to car segment specifically in the developed markets. Besides, sustainability issues related to vehicle end-of-life management are rarely considered. Our findings suggest that the Chinese truck sector needs an integrated result-oriented PSS business model which could be implemented in other developing countries.

Abstract: Abstract
While Product Service Systems (PSS) are not inherently sustainable, they may form part of the mix of innovations that contribute to the development of more sustainable futures. However, whether the current trajectory of PSS research, with its emphasis on universal frameworks and standardisation adequately reflects and builds upon PSS diversity revealed by case study research may be questioned. Opportunities for transition to more sustainable PSS may be lost. In response, this paper draws on sustainable architecture to propose fluid transitions to more sustainable PSS: to PSS design practices that embrace diversity and enable specific PSS to be developed which address contextual interpretations of sustainability challenges. The core ideas of the PSS design are critically engaged in light of the principles and priorities of fluid transitions. Research directions to support fluid transitions to more sustainable PSS design practices are then explicated.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product Service System (PSS) thinking can be applied to production system by considering it as a product. Prior studies show that strategic planning of the maintenance activities in manufacturing industries holds great potential to increase productivity. Planning of maintenance activities is therefore an integral decision making aspect for maintenance engineers and it is important to analyze how industries are currently working with planning of maintenance activities and what additional support is needed. This paper aims at mapping the current state of the work procedures for maintenance engineers and planners in the industry and analyzes the gap from current practices to the strategic planning which could increase productivity. The study specifically focuses on how industries work today with finding critical resource, performing criticality analysis, and planning maintenance. A descriptive research approach is followed, where empirical data is collected in Swedish industry through three different data collection methods. The results show the state-of-art industrial practices and the gaps in maintenance planning.

Abstract: Abstract
While the IPS2-Execution System (IPS2-ES) supports the IPS2 provider during the IPS2 delivery, there is still no adequate tool to measure and evaluate the performance of the organization of the IPS2 delivery system. Especially the complexity of the automatic planning and control mechanisms of the IPS2-ES leads to the problem that the output of the system cannot be manually controlled. Hence, an automated method has to be designed to measure and rate the resulting IPS2 with a focus on IPS2 delivery planning and the IPS2 network. This paper presents a concept for an IPS2 performance measurement method for the organization of the IPS2 delivery. It considers resource planning, partner network and IT. Key figures have an important role for the performance concept and will be introduced in the concept. Additionally, a prototypical software implementation will be demonstrated.

Abstract: In parallel with the product-to-service transition in the manufacturing industries, service-dominant logic has emerged as arguably the most challenging recent scholarly marketing debate. The objectives of this work are: (1) to delineate the distinct differences between a product-to-service transition and a transition from a goods-dominant to a service-dominant logic, (2) to discuss what these transitions mean for industry and academia, and (3) to suggest a revised definition of industrial product/service systems (IPS2) more in line with service-dominant logic. A transition to service-dominant logic implies much more than an increased emphasis on services; it implies a reframing of the purpose of the firm and its role in value co-creation.

Abstract: Abstract
Prior research has demonstrated that a disassembly based end-of-life (EoL) treatment for electronic products is characterized by the highest recovery rates for precious metals (PMs) and non-commodity plastics, such as flame retardant plastics. Nonetheless, EoL electronic products are nowadays also commonly recycled without disassembly in different types of size-reduction based treatments or in an integrated PM smelter-refinery. This disparity of recycling processes adopted worldwide resulted in a high uncertainty on the EoL treatment processes that will be adopted for discarded electronic products. As a result, governments, original equipment manufacturers and recycling companies struggle to determine the economic and environmental value of design for disassembly. For this reason, a methodology is presented to calculate the Composite Rate of Return (CRR) on investing in design for disassembly and the resulting environmental impacts. This methodology is applied to evaluate the economic and environmental benefits of implementing three types of active fasteners for eleven electronic products which are available in both a product service system (PSS) and a traditional sales oriented business model. The performed analyses demonstrate that the preferred EoL treatment, as well as the economic and environmental benefits of implementing design for active disassembly, strongly depends on several product properties and boundary conditions. Based on the performed sensitivity analysis, the application of active pressure and temperature sensitive fasteners is expected to be only economically viable for products placed on the market in a PSS context, in which they will be separately collected with a high collection rate. Furthermore, impulse sensitive elastomer based fasteners are characterized with the highest rate of return and considered to be suited for both products sold in a traditional sales oriented business model and for products used in a PSS.

Abstract: To systematically exploit the potentials of technical services for both manufacturers and their industrial customers, products and services need to be integrated. The resulting industrial product–service systems (PSS) are realized by the members of a value creation network in close cooperation with the customers. Thus, the organizational and operational structure of the value creation network has to be designed in order to guarantee the PSS-provider a continuous product, customer and market feedback. This feedback information provides the basis for a continuous PSS-improvement process, comprising customer specific and customer spanning improvement measures. This paper analyzes the demands on a continuous improvement process (CIP) of PSS and provides a framework concept for a PSS specific CIP. A real-world case study of an industrial PSS-CIP concludes the paper.

Abstract: In the past, there has been a lot of research on Product-Service Systems (PSS) – integrated bundles of products and services. However, the topic has been basically independently discussed by researchers of different disciplines. The purpose of this paper is to integrate the results of the fields of Information Systems, Business Management, and Engineering &amp; Design and hence to investigate the state-of-the-art in PSS research by conducting a structured literature review. In total 265 articles have been intensively analyzed. A unified core definition of the PSS term is derived as well as the notion of the concept in the three disciplines is explained and summarized. A meta-analysis of previous literature reviews completes the picture. Based on our data it is shown that the understanding of PSS is very different in the three disciplines. Therefore, a research agenda for future research is developed which includes for example the need for clarifying the terminology, changing perspectives, and conducting more evaluations.

Abstract: Abstract
With the development of information and communications technology, people are gradually replacing paper maps with vehicle telematics systems (VTS). VTS provides customers with navigation services, as well as other functions and system services. This study discusses the development trend of VTS products/services and customers’ needs for navigation and location services, audio–video and entertainment services, communications and information services and safety and security services. Automobile manufacturers and VTS product/service providers should determine new product development strategies based on their customers’ needs, as these needs will directly influence future sales. To assist in determining customers’ VTS needs and intentions, this study evaluated customers’ important VTS product/service criteria. A novel MCDM (Multiple Criteria Decision-making) model was applied that integrated four MCDM techniques: decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL); principal component analysis (PCA); analytical network procedures (ANP); and Vlse Kriterijumska Optimizacija I Kompromisno Resenje (VIKOR). These four techniques were applied to determine the product’s position and improve the four VTS service systems for obtaining the best win–win service solution. This paper proposed the key driving aspect of the four VTS service systems and determined their product’s position based on the proposed model. The conclusions are also suggestions for service providers to improve upon existing service functions and plan further utilities for the next generation of VTS service systems. This study also aids VTS service system providers in determining their product’s position and proposing their new value position.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing companies are increasingly becoming aware that the sale of a product does not end when the good is delivered to the customer. On the contrary, the product must be followed by the company throughout its life cycle; from its conception to its disposal. An increasingly common practice is to support the entire chain of sales and after sales, from dealers to end customers, with a range of services that give the product added value. For example in the field of crane manufacturers for trucks, Fassi Gru S.p.a. provides, in addition to its product training for the use and maintenance of cranes, tools for the simulation of the lifting capacity of the crane (Fassi Installation Program), monitoring of usage statistics and the state of wear of the crane (Fassi SmartApp, Internet of CraneTM), control of residual life, and the status and timing of maintenance (Maintenance Assistant). The work presented here is a new after sale service designed to identify quickly and easily the element that caused the failure of the crane through a series of guided questions about the behavior of the crane subject to malfunctions. This tool is called FIT (Fault Investigator Tool) and allows the network service Fassi rapid and accurate diagnosis of the cause of failure in case of malfunctions of the crane; reducing the time to diagnosis and avoiding unnecessary and costly replacement components by trial and error. The novelty of this work lies in the method used to achieve it; FIT was in fact created by the special knowledge gained from R&amp;D engineers of Fassi about new methods of systematic innovation developed by the University of Bergamo. In this article some of these techniques are shown: in particular those dealing with the correct formulation of the problem, the functional analysis and the Anticipatory Failure Determination; a particular instrument that combines FMEA (Failure modes and effects analysis) and TRIZ (Theory of inventive problem solving). The article will also present the needs that led to the development of the tool and show the operation of the instrument through a case study; showing all the advantages provided by its application.

Abstract: Abstract
The clothing industry is in need of innovative business models that can reduce its environmental footprint for which product-service systems (PSS) may provide many opportunities. The chief objective of this study was to identify the positive and negative perceptions of clothing product-service systems (PSS) for the purpose of determining barriers as well as pathways to viability. A mixed-methods study was conducted in Finland. Findings from this study indicate a moderate level of interest in a variety of clothing-related PSS features, with the highest level of interest in clothing take-back, swaps, and consultancy. PSS schemes evidencing experiential, innovative and social approaches (renting, swapping and fashion result) were perceived to be best suited for younger consumers while services that emphasized product satisfaction (e.g. redesign, repair/maintenance, customization, consultancy) were perceived to be most suited for older consumers. Attributes most contributing to positive perceptions of the clothing PSS were environmental benefits as well as emotional aspects, such as experiential or social features of the PSS model, the ability to meet fashion needs, and increased product satisfaction. Negative perceptions were most driven by a lack of trust in the service provider and perceived barriers to ease of use, such as a lack of accessibility to the product or the technical requirements that may be commanded.

Abstract: Abstract
Determined by an integrated value proposition PSS constitute a unique organizational setup that is pivotally grounded in the co-existence of integrated but yet separate product-, service- and customer sub-systems. In order to benefit from the variety of available skills, competences and knowledge resources, PSS try to arrange sub-system boundaries most permeable, thus striving for the highest possible level of integration. At the same time, PSS decrease the level of divisional separation towards a minimum. However, the relation of integration and separation needs further analysis in the light of organizational theory. While recognizing the need for increasing integration towards product&amp;service co-designed, customer integrated solutions, research also claims that a separation-typed setup determines the crucial resource configuration that is needed for novel problem-solving approaches in PSS. More precisely, it is said that the upholding of a minimal threshold between separated organizational elements secures sufficient tension between established organizational thought-worlds which again may initiate processes of organizational learning and renewal. The contradictory nature of decreasing while also pertaining separation under the umbrella of an integrated organizational setup raises the need for a nuanced understanding of how boundaries within PSS form an important area of operation for the dynamic balancing of divisional knowledge transfer versus identity-shaping. With reference to the organizational development process towards a fully integrated PSS this paper presents suggestions about how PSS can design minimal threshold for a mutual but fluid co-existence of product-, service- and customer sub-systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Compared with Computer Aided Design (CAD) to use computer graphics technologies to describe geometric information for the product design, many new methodologies and systems have been developed in the past decades in product modeling to extend the functions of the traditional CAD systems. In the product representation aspect, in addition to the design solution usually modeled by geometric descriptions, modeling of product knowledge has been widely investigated to describe the rationale for creation of the product solution. In the information technology aspect, in addition to the traditional computing tools such as computer programming languages and object oriented design, distributed computing technologies particularly Internet, web and cloud computing tools have been widely employed to implement product modeling systems. In the product development process aspect, in addition to the design solution, other product lifecycle aspects such as manufacturing, maintenance and service have been modeled and integrated into the same environment. In this literature review, the recent advances of research on product modeling in product representation, information technologies and product development process are investigated from these three new perspectives: knowledge, distributed computing, and product lifecycle. In addition, traditional methodologies and future challenges in computer-based product modeling are also discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
The purpose of this research is to help manufacturing companies identify the key performance evaluation criteria for achieving customer satisfaction through Balanced Scorecard (BSC) and Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) approaches. To explore the causal relationships among the four dimensions of business performance in Balanced Scorecard as well as their key performance criteria, a MCDM approach combining DEMATEL and ANP techniques is adopted. Subsequently, the MCDM framework is tested using Delphi method and a questionnaire survey is conducted in 24 manufacturing firms from Taiwan, Vietnam and Thailand.

The research findings indicate that manufacturing companies should focus more on improving customer perspectives such as customer satisfaction and customer loyalty by integrating products and services innovation and providing diversified value-added product–service offerings as well as developing close long-term partnership with customers. In addition, the classification of importance and improvability into four strategic planning zones provide practicing managers with a decision making tool for prioritizing continuous improvement projects and effectively allocating their resources to those key criteria identified in the strategic map for business performance improvement.

By identifying critical criteria and their interrelationships, our research results can help manufacturing companies enhance their business performance in both financial and non-financial perspectives. They can also serve as valuable guidelines and references for manufacturing companies to achieve better customer satisfaction through sustainable product–service system practices.

Abstract: More and more manufacturers are transitioning from product-focused operations towards global service-oriented operations through approaches such as an industrial product-service system (IPS2). These systems deliver a blend of goods, equipment and services for improved value/revenue streams and there is a need to leverage the knowledge of domain experts in evaluating the uncertainties of IPS2 adoption.

Along these lines, this article proposes a hybrid fuzzy methodology that leverages the knowledge of domain experts for evaluating the uncertainty of service networks that deliver an IPS2. The proposed methodology conceptualises a framework of network uncertainty metrics and applies a set of fuzzy-based techniques (fuzzy Delphi, fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (fuzzy AHP) and fuzzy Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (fuzzy TOPSIS)) to evaluate levels of fuzziness for transitions from traditional product-focused operations towards service-oriented operations. The applicability of the proposed methodology is demonstrated through a case study of a stainless steel manufacturer and the limitations and generalisation potentials of the research are used to highlight future research challenges for service-oriented uncertainty evaluation.

Abstract: Abstract
Although the existing literature indicates that the business model concept can be useful to implement product–service systems (PSS), there is still a paucity of guidelines to assist companies in this respect. Therefore, this paper proposes a framework to support the adoption of PSS employing the business model concept. This framework was developed based on literature review and intends to guide the company on the analysis of their business context, on the choice of the appropriate type of PSS and on the definition of their PSS characteristics. A single case study was then performed to illustrate an application of the framework in a machine tool manufacturer and provide research insights. Overall, results indicate that the framework can provide companies with a useful reference to PSS implementation, helping on the investigation of different PSS scenarios as well as the main barriers and challenges to be overcome.

Abstract: Abstract
The paper aims to explain and analyze how the construction industry can benefit from PSS, and how collaborative approaches such as partnering can be a stepping stone in this transition. The potential sub-optimization between construction and maintenance, as well as the necessity of availability in roads for example, make Product Service Systems a suitable approach for improvement. Adapted solutions though the iterative design approach, co-located actors, an active buyer and functioning information flows resulted in a successful project. Interviews conducted with the buyer, the contractor and the design consultant, as well as project documentation, were used to collect data.

Abstract: Abstract
Limited insight is available regarding the benefits of an Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO) as a possibility to encapsulate a technology. This paper applies a framework termed the PCP (Provider – Customer – Product) Triangle to two cases. The PCP Triangle aims to identify benefits (including technology encapsulation) and risks of IPSOs in a systematic manner. In one case, a technology is the core of the offering and IPSO is an alternative as a business model. The other case concerns biogas production, where know-how to control the production is one of the key assets of the provider to add value. By doing so, it validates the PCP Triangle further with cases and explains how it can be used. The results show that the PCP Triangle is a simple but effective tool to describe and visualize the flow of information around the product by discussing strategies for keeping the firm's intelligence in manufacturing. The paper also discusses the IPSO's contribution to environmental performance.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) are a new way of providing customer value and therefore represent globally competitive manufacturing systems. Multiple networked partners are involved in the delivery of the IPS2, i.e. the customer, the IPS2 provider and suppliers. The information provided by the partners and the supplied resources need to be coordinated, controlled and managed by a software system. In this paper, an architecture and a conceptual design for such a system, called IPS2-Execuion System, is presented. For this architecture, the structure of the IPS2 organization, among others, has to be taken into account.

Abstract: Abstract
Innovation processes are subject to various internal and external cycles. Changes of the environment of the system from a business perspective such as the readiness of new technologies or shifting requirements due to changing customer demands, or other cycles can affect the system as they significantly influence its innovation process. Especially companies providing PSS are affected by these cycles because physical product and service aspects as well as a high number of stakeholders have to be integrated during the design and development phase. While in conventional development processes dynamics caused by the occurrence of cycles already play a major role, the influence of dynamic aspects in the development of PSS is further enhanced. In particular, the high degree of crosslinking between the different phases of the innovation process leads to highly dynamic responses within the innovation process. A lack of knowledge and the challenging handling of these cycles and their dependencies and effects lead to challenges. In highly dynamic systems, the classical approaches of process modelling often reach their limits, as the depicted elements and relations are usually assumed to be static. Consequently, it is hard to predict the dynamic impact of cyclic changes on the innovation process of PSS. There are approaches to model the dynamics of systems such as System Dynamics, agent-based modelling or discrete event simulation. Especially System Dynamics is used throughout the public and private sector for policy analysis and design. It is a method to analyse and simulate the dynamic behaviour of systems on a high level of abstraction. Therefore, within this paper, a System Dynamics based impact analysis of cyclic changes within innovation processes of PSS is suggested. We provide background information on the innovation process of PSS, how they are challenged by cycles and how this approach can be used for modelling innovation processes and on the influence of cycles on these processes. An exemplary case study is presented to show the application of our approach on an innovation process of a PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Today, in an Industry 4.0 factory, machines are connected as a collaborative community. Such evolution requires the utilization of advance- prediction tools, so that data can be systematically processed into information to explain uncertainties, and thereby make more “informed” decisions. Cyber-Physical System-based manufacturing and service innovations are two inevitable trends and challenges for manufacturing industries. This paper addresses the trends of manufacturing service transformation in big data environment, as well as the readiness of smart predictive informatics tools to manage big data, thereby achieving transparency and productivity.

Abstract: Abstract
The global crisis and the fierce competition of emerging countries make companies struggling to stay ahead of competition. The number of companies that are enlarging their offer portfolio looking forward to new and increased sources of revenues is always increasing but the number of companies failing in successfully implementing servitization strategy is even more. One possible reason behind this is the lack of tools to support companies while dealing with services that by definition are characterized by high level of intangibility and perishability.

The Service Engineering (SE) discipline that is currently working for an integrated development of tools and methodologies specifically related to services is still under development and the existing methodologies are more oriented to the manufacturing context. In the SE context Pezzotta et al., in 2014 suggested the SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) for the engineering and the re-engineering of new service or Product-Service System (PSS) helping the companies in balancing their internal performance with the service value perceived by the customer. This paper aims at understanding the industrial applicability of such methodology. It presents a real case study carried out in collaboration with ABB Spa, a leading provider in power and automation technology. In the paper, all the steps performed during the application of the SEEM are described, together with the difficulties encountered. Some insights obtained with the application are also described.

Abstract: Abstract
The Maintenance Service Support System (MS3) is under development within an industry transfer project. The industry transfer partner is a medium-sized German machine tool manufacturer that is providing maintenance services for its machines. MS3 will support the staff of maintenance departments in service planning and delivery of maintenance services via comprehensive information provision and active support of human-machine interaction.

MS3 uses process models of maintenance services as input. Although a substantial effort is required to generate the first process model, the further process models (i.e. for other machines or maintenance processes) can be derived much more easily. This paper is concerned with the future processes of implementing MS3 in maintenance departments. These processes are complex and individual for each company. Therefore, a systematic approach is essential to reduce the effort to the necessary minimum. In this paper, these processes will be illustrated and an estimation of efforts will be provided.

Abstract: Abstract
New standards are needed to codify recent developments in thinking and emerging best practice in engineering services: those collaborative technical and engineering activities that contribute to a business service that is enabled by keeping complex, long-life engineering assets operational at minimum cost. Such services are illustrated by the engineering involved in what have been called “complex service systems” or “product-service systems” and need the engineering activity and resource to be integrated with the overall service provision eco-system. This means that engineers and engineering have a critical role to play within the overall service delivery system displaying new, integrated behaviors and complementary competencies to support the service paradigm. To support successful service outcomes, this requires a very different set of behaviors and processes to those prevalent in the traditional arcane and transactional approach of systems engineering or physical asset management. A new framework standard is proposed, together with guidance on the application of relevant existing process and technical standards, to support the build of best practice and innovation in this area of interest to servitized and servitizing manufacturers.

Abstract: Today's corporate environment is characterized by growing dynamics and uncertainties. Here, flexibility gains importance as a critical success factor. This is especially true for those innovative business models, which have in common relational and long-term customer-supplier relationships. As a solution to the mentioned uncertainties connected with such a business relationship, one can think of flexibility designed Industrial Product-Service Systems. The contribution at hand focuses on contracts to control customer-supplier relationships, which remain incomplete due to their long-term horizon and the resulting uncertainties and therefore implicate incentive problems and, thus, inefficiencies. We can show that by re-allocating property rights in use-oriented business models it is possible to distribute incentives and risks more uniformly and to better balance the interests of customers and suppliers. Doing so, the leeway resulting from these incomplete contracts should nor be interpreted as a risk anymore but more as an opportunity to exploit the accordant development of flexible Industrial Product-Service Systems. Our contribution points out the importance of flexibility and describes the opportunity to detect the optimal degree of flexibility of such a system.

Abstract: Abstract
Sentiment analysis emerged as an important research topic for its potential in tapping into the large amount of opinions that became a central piece of social networks, providing companies who have any kind of public feedback with new insights on their products and services. Research in this field focuses mainly on the semantic aspects of sentiment recognition and, in more recent years, on the impact of influence in propagation of opinions. Here we present a model that aggregates both these aspects and focuses on providing a framework for calculating global sentiments. The model is based on current literature and provides information regarding not only polarity of opinions, but also on other aspects that affect their diffusion and prevalence, such as influence, reach, ambiguity and relevance. The global sentiment is the result of a weighted evaluation of these aspects and is used both for estimating current sentiment towards an object and for predicting future trends in sentiment.

Abstract: Abstract
The necessity for manufacturing equipment producers of providing Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2) as opposed to selling sole products is well-known. Reasons for focusing on increased customer value are the long-term customer retention and high flexibility throughout the entire lifecycle. This kind of customization creates a win-win situation for both, customers and providers.

However, the establishment of integrated development tools to design these holistic solutions is still sparse. Reasons for this are the multiple viewpoints, models and methods which are relevant for a holistic design. An IPS2 compromises different actors, organizations, objects and processes. It is required to fulfill specific customer needs which go beyond the core competences of one single provider. Furthermore, the business model, customer-provider networks and organizational boundary conditions have a higher influence on solution properties than they have in design processes for traditional products.

In this context, specific focus must be put on early design stages. Key properties of the design solution and its architecture are determined in line with cooperation networks in this crucial design phase. Presently, numerous specific methods and tools are provided to support systematic development, yet without the possibility of using them in an integrated environment. Therefore, a method base is required which includes these different methods. Furthermore, this method base has to provide possibilities of connecting data models of different tools in order to create holistic descriptions of IPS2.

This paper describes one such method base, that of IT based Product-Service Innovation. Within this framework single developers as well as development teams are guided to a value oriented design process. Within this framework a concept for the integration of different methodological IPS2 design approaches is presented. It is based on the principles of situative method engineering and enables the integrated method application for specific design issues in early design phases of these systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Maintainability and serviceability are the most important factors which influence the delivery of Product Service Systems (PSS). To enhance the maintainability and serviceability for collaborative service in the context of PSS, a decision-making method for the delivery management of PSS is urgent needed both in practical and theoretical aspects. This study proposed a method to solve a collaborative service decision-making problem for the delivery management of PSS and to assess its performance. Several service stations with specific service area are supposed to satisfy the collection of service requirements from several customers in the joint area collaboratively by sharing vehicle fleets, service workers, and so on. A mathematical model was built with constraints of technician number, skill, time windows, maximum driving distance for the vehicles, and collaborative service options. A hybrid algorithm of PSO (Particle Swarm Optimization) and GA (Genetic Algorithm) is given to solve this practical large-scale problem. An empirical study of agricultural machinery maintenance clearly demonstrated that the proposed methods are effective and the algorithms can provide reasonable solutions within an acceptable computational time. Moreover, by comparing the total cost of the independent service mode with the collaborative mode, we concluded that the collaborative service total cost outperforms the non-cooperative one. Undoubtedly, our method is quite effective and can be used to improve the performance of collaborative service decision-making for the delivery management of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
Knowledge of service delivery is an asset and a competitive edge to service providers. However, the providers in the IT industry have not utilized the asset satisfactorily yet, as their clients’ requirements have some ambiguities due to the demand for fast and incremental web service production under ‘cloud’ environments. To increase reusability of data developed in the past, this paper proposes a method to identify suitable assets from service repositories with set-based synthesis of both designers’ and operators’ intentions. This paper also discusses kernel states, which provide disciplines for collaboration among practitioners in service production and adjust the assets for later explored requirements.

Abstract: Abstract
Business Models in manufacturing are focused on selling tangible products and are in danger of being copied by competitors from emerging economies. In response, the value share of services is increased to parity with the product and beyond. To realize such an “Extended Product” (EP), manufacturers need to establish a “Manufacturing Service Ecosystem” (MSE) with adequate service providers, requiring radical changes to the business model. This paper describes a methodology that enables manufacturers to integrate EP and MSE into their business models and analyzes the results of its application in four manufacturing case studies from different countries and industrial sectors.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) are characterized through the customer individual configuration of product and service shares to fulfill customer needs. Thus, the ability to react on changing customer requirements is mandatory. There are common approaches which focus on the early stage of the IPS2 development, thereby the implementation phase appears untended. In this article an approach for the flexible implementation of IPS2 is presented, which considers the research of service-oriented architecture (SOA). Furthermore the prototypical realization in the area of micro production is described. The results described in this paper allow IPS2 providers to react on changing requirements by flexible arranging of functionality in terms of services and IPS2 network partners.

Abstract: Abstract
IPSS are popular in different fields of transport, mainly for personal use (car-sharing, bike-sharing). Their usage in urban goods transport is not still generalized but those systems present a good potential. This paper proposed to assess and analyze four different scenarios for urban goods transport to compare IPSS configurations to a business as usual situation, in terms of environmental impacts. Those impacts will be estimated via a life cycle analysis (LCA) method. First, the four scenarios are presented. The first scenario is the reference one, i.e. the business as usual situation. The other three scenarios represent possible IPSS configuration, i.e. a vehicle leasing system, a vehicle sharing system and an urban consolidation system. Second, the methodology for scenario assessment using LCA is described, and the main proposed indicators defined. Third, the main results of the scenario assessment are presented, analyzed and discussed. Finally, future researches are proposed.

Abstract: Abstract
The complexity of the challenges in the water sector means that innovative solutions are required. These solutions include not only new sustainable technologies for water treatment, but also complementary innovation in business models to support the adoption of these technologies in urban areas. This paper aims to explore the role of sustainable business models in supporting technological innovations such as decentralized approaches for water quality and quantity improvements in urban areas. The private sector involvement can be valuable in overcoming the barriers and challenges to implementation of those approaches as well as to achieve the sustainability. A case study of the product-service system as a sustainable business model in an emerging economy was conducted to deliver insights into the role of new ways of value proposition, value creation, and value capture in supporting innovative technologies in the water sector and in contributing to sustainability. The results demonstrated that consumers' acceptance, risk perception, and confidence in decentralized approaches can be improved with the support of business models through a close integration with customers. The close integration among the actors can also lead to better management of the system. Further research can focus on how different types of sustainable business models could contribute to supporting water technologies in urban areas and increase social acceptability.

Abstract: Academic and business interests in the product-service system have risen significantly in recent years. The product-service system represents a competitive opportunity for many companies as they seek to reduce consumption by altering how their products are used by providing services. To further establish this field, the objective of this paper is to present a literature review on the product-service system, including 149 papers published from 2006 to 2010. The review discusses specific features of the product-service system as well as the benefits and drawbacks that the literature has addressed in recent years. Positive and negative issues of the product-service system are also covered. It is evident that the research in this area is still dominated by theoretical work, and additional empirical research is required. Selected research perspectives are identified that encourage future research.

Abstract: Abstract
Servitization literature suggests that traditional manufacturing companies are increasingly offering industrial services in order to increase their position in the global competition. However, little is known about extent and profit potential of different types of such offers in current industry. This paper offers an overview of such offers and concludes that maintenance based business models are most closely linked to increased revenue generation while add-on services have a negative effect. Future trends, suggest that business models such as R&amp;D services and functional services will be increasingly important in the future.

Abstract: In manufacturing, systems combining physical products and services have been attracting much attention. For such systems, designers need to consider values for customers as well as its economic cost. However, services include many stochastic elements because they are severely affected by human behaviors and interaction between humans. Therefore, parameters that affect the economic cost, such as working time and number of operation, vary because of the influence of the stochastic elements. In order to evaluate design solution from the viewpoint of the economic cost, this study proposes a service cost simulation method in consideration of stochastic elements in the service.

Abstract: Abstract
Ecology and industry, which have been many times considered as antagonists, are now associated together in the sustainability concept to support the three social / economic / environment pillars. In that way, industrial enterprises and more precisely manufacturing ones seek to integrate environment into their strategy by conducting an innovative rationalization of the production as promoted by industrial ecology and circular economy paradigms. This rationalization is favoring the evolution from product to a Product-Service Systems approach (PSS). The continuity of these services is mainly carried out by the maintenance which is no longer an aftermarket service needed for product (system) functionality but rather an inherent service function of the product (system). Thus this paper aims to investigate the role of maintenance to contribute to the development of these paradigms. It is based first on describing the main features of industrial ecology/circular economy transposing the nature concepts to industrial system. It leads to define key principles and levers to be addressed for the development of industrial ecosystems. Then maintenance activity is globally presented allowing, in a second step, to place maintenance services already existing in line with some of these principles and levers (ex. green maintenance), but also to explore advanced maintenance services more able to support promotion of industrial ecosystem by covering others principles and levers. These advanced services can be built from conventional maintenance processes but integrating sustainability goal (ex. prognostics of energy efficiency) or from innovative processes (ex. regenerative management). Finally scientific issues related to these advanced maintenance services are underlining and should concretize future research directions for researchers/practitioners working on maintenance field.

Abstract: In the past decade, personal customers expected manufacturing companies to provide them with a physical product with, nonetheless, some basic additional services. Currently, customers expect a more comprehensive solution, integrating both a physical product and non-physical services, which explains why companies have started to propose Product-Service Systems (PSS). The underlying objective of profitability can be attained if the system is designed, based on system use, to avoid waste, and if services are developed jointly with products. Although all the requisite conditions are well-known, the optimal way to satisfy them is not formalized or even guided by any clear methodology. This paper proposes to create PSS models to be simulated in different service scenarios based on G-DEVS/HLA. The simulation results provide pointers to help decision maker choose between several PSS design scenarios to be manufactured. A case study from the toy industry is used to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Abstract: Abstract
Lean theory, principles and tools, are intended to highlight the value within the company and eliminate waste entirely. Despite the large amount of literature work on lean, there is a lack of in-depth analysis for collection and categorization of specific lean rules for the manufacturing industry. Therefore, the present work proposes a classification, formalization and identification of lean rules, in order to create a comprehensive and applicable library of lean rules, after the investigation of academic literature and a mould-making industry. Finally, the “drawer” idea is introduced aiming to motivate employees of different hierarchical levels in the lean rules development.

Abstract: Abstract
There is an increasing interest to ensure operational and maintenance (O&amp;M) operations from a strategic perspective, and there are opportunities for both producing companies and service providers to gain benefits. Research shows that the combined business models (products combined with services) have a positive effect on the business. Likewise, it is profitable to think strategically and in long term for enterprises offering maintenance services, especially using performance-based models. But for achieving these benefits the view of the business has to change. The focus should be on the values created and not in the offers in form of products or services. Moreover, the company needs to position itself as an actor not only in the value chain, but in a wider context referred to as the business ecosystem. Making such a shift of focus is hard though, and there is a need to understand both the current state of the business as well as the potential future directions.

The framework presented in this paper is an attempt to meet these needs. The framework describes business model development in four levels. From maturity point of view, the four steps could be seen as the logical development of the business model from a narrow technical perspective to a holistic product-service perspective. The four levels could also be connected to the industrial development where level four supports Industry 4.0. Level four is referred to as Service Management 4.0. In particular, four key concepts reflect the concept of Service Management 4.0: the mix of products and services in customer offers, performance-based contracts, partnering and the business ecology concept.

Abstract: Abstract
The aim of this paper is to explore priorities of supply chain partners for the integrated flow of information during the provision of industrial services. We adopted a qualitative multi-case logic methodology and a research model of flow integration and partnership uncertainty which we applied in an exploratory study with five major companies that provide aerospace services. From the analysis, we found that in view of the challenges for reducing partnership uncertainty and for enhancing integrated flow, firms prioritised how historical service data was made available to authorised staff and how lessons were learnt from existing service projects. We also found that congruity of aircraft platforms and duologues during service phases are important priorities in decision making situations of firms towards their supply chains for industrial services; and that these priorities are often driven by unplugged communication gaps and obsolescence of technologies.

The extremely knowledge-intensive sector of the tool and die industry is forced to reduce costs due to raising international competition. This paper deals with the development and implementation of a knowledge transfer system in order to reduce costs by avoiding mistakes in the tool making process and cutting costs of rework. It constitutes typical weak points concerning shared information and explains a systematic knowledge feedback chain. Additionally it describes the application of supporting knowledge distribution tools, for example mobile tablet apps, and gives examples regarding an improved information flow along the process chain of the tool and die industry.

Abstract: Compared to product design, a broader range of knowledge is required to Product-Service System (PSS) design, since both products and services are included in its design space. In this paper, a method for knowledge-based PSS design support is proposed. The proposed method is on the basis of the research on Japanese Service Engineering, which provides design methodology of the integrated provision of products and services. In addition, a prototype of computer-aided design (CAD) system to realize knowledge-based PSS design support is developed. The method and system support the acquisition of new PSS design solutions by integrating knowledge accumulated in a knowledge base. The developed system was applied to a design of an actual service: an accommodation service in Japan. The application result showed that the developed system was useful to support a design of the integrated provision of products and services.

Abstract: Abstract
In the electric car industry the service component assumes considerable importance and it is a relevant factor in purchasing decisions. Therefore, proper management of the “Product-Service System” (PSS) is essential. This article aims to 1) identify the main sub-systems of the PSS in the electric car industry and 2) identify the critical success factors (CSFs) in marketing. The review of the literature led to the definition of four sub-systems: vehicle, infrastructure, on-board electronics, and energy. Based on these PSS sub-systems, organisations belonging to each sub-system were selected, and five managers were interviewed. The data were analysed using a cognitive mapping technique.

Ten CSFs were identified, of which two belong to the vehicle sub-system (value proposition and product-service system bundle); one relates to the electronic on-board sub-system (advanced navigation systems); three relate to infrastructure sub-system (incentives, alternative transport systems and advocacy campaigns) and three belong to infrastructure and energy sub-systems (ease of use, proximity of charging point and standardisation). Finally, partnerships among players involve all the four sub-systems. Moreover, the relevance/manageability matrix offers evidence that partnerships represent a priority factor that requires immediate action from companies. The research offers a new means to identify CSFs by using a PSS analysis rather than taking an industry sector perspective.

Abstract: Abstract
In order to continually make a profit, It is important for companies to prevent service failure. For preventing service failure, at first, service designers need to extract their factors that cause service failures and to understand their relationships. However, service failure factors and their relations are varied compared to physical products because service failures occur due to various human factors. Therefore, service designers should identify the critical failure factors from a number of failure factors. On the other hand, each service provider has different recognition for relationships among service failure factors. Therefore, it is necessary to understand his/her recognition of the structure of service failure factors and to achieve a consensus to the structure. This paper proposes a method to identify common parts and/or differences among his/her recognition, and then, to support to achieve a consensus to the structure of service failure factors. The proposed method is verified through its application to a practical case.

Abstract: Abstract
Collaborative consumption is an emerging socio-economic model based on sharing, renting, gifting, bartering, swapping, lending and borrowing. Made possible through community interaction and, increasingly, use of network technologies, these alternative and more sustainable ways of consuming have attracted growing attention for their potential to prevent new purchases, intensify the use of idle assets and promote reuse of possessions that are no longer wanted. Nonetheless, the uptake of Product-Service Systems (PSSs) that enable collaborative consumption is still very limited. This paper investigates how consumers' values can influence the acceptance, adoption and diffusion of collaborative consumption. It reviews two theoretical frameworks used to understand pro-environmental behaviour, social psychological models of behaviour and social practice theory. Coming from contrasting disciplinary perspectives, these approaches conceptualise values differently. The paper evaluates the possibility of resolving these differences through a mixed methods study. It examines values empirically through a case study of Ecomodo, a UK-based online marketplace where people can lend and borrow each other's objects, spaces and skills, and present the results of a quantitative study which identified and measured value priorities among Ecomodo users through Schwartz's Portrait Value Questionnaire. It concludes with a discussion of the role of values in relation to the introduction and scaling up of PSSs that enable collaborative consumption.

Abstract: Abstract
The paper presents the results of experimental activities aiming at investigating the role of ‘value models’ as ‘boundary objects’ that facilitate cross-functional discussions in the PSS conceptual design phase. The experiment featured 6 separate sessions involving a total of 22 students in the final year of three different Master Programmes. In the sessions participants were asked to redesign an asphalt compactor and to use different types of design decision support for this task, namely value models vs. requirements checklists. The recordings from the experiment were analysed using protocol analysis to compare the behaviour of teams. The results confirm the hypothesis that, compared to traditional requirement checklists, value models emphasizes activities related to the clarification (1) of the problem domain and needs and (2) of the lifecycle aspects of a solution concept. Both results suggest that value models have the ability to facilitate cross-boundary discussion in the early phases of the PSS design process, and to act as boundary objects that provide a common platform for knowledge sharing within the cross-functional team.

Abstract: Abstract
Our goal in this paper is to analyze the evolution of the corporate culture required for the process of servitization through changes in practical, behavioral and intellectual habits. The purpose is to gain a better understanding of the process by which an enterprise can change its culture from a product based culture to a service based one in the specific context of SMEs. We use a single case study to understand in depth the effects of a change in company corporate culture. The case study concerns a SME in the Rhne-Alpes Region in France, which specializes in remanufacturing appliances. In 2012, the general manager began a process of started a strategic reflection on servitization in order to diversify the enterprise's activities and unlock new markets. However, the adoption of servitization requires profound modifications in the company's organization, and particularly in its corporate culture. In order to better understand this change, we suggest considering it as a learning process.

Abstract: Abstract
It is a global trend nowadays for manufacturing and service firms to create and increase customer value either during initial design of a product/service or by modifying their existing products/service. When a product already exists, customer value can be increased by adding new qualities/features to a traditional product that would add much needed services while keeping price competitive. Qualities, such as foldability and mobility when product is not in use, are examples of creating and improving customer value. This paper presents a design model that helps designers incorporate foldability, mobility and personalization in a regular product design.

Abstract: Abstract
Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2) are delivered in networks consisting of IPS2 provider, customer and various suppliers of service and product shares. For successful IPS2 delivery, these networks must be managed effectively. In particular, having the right resources available when and where needed is crucial to delivering superior customer value. At the same time, innovative IPS2 business models increasingly gain importance and need to be considered during the organization of IPS2 delivery. Depending on the contracted revenue model, the objectives of IPS2 delivery planning can vary from one IPS2 to the other, with influences on required lead times and the capacity level, which needs to be maintained. Furthermore, several other business model characteristics, such as the risk distribution, property rights and process responsibility, will have an influence on IPS2 delivery, which need to be considered in IPS2 network planning.

In this paper, an agent-based simulation approach for strategic IPS2 network planning is presented,which is able to cover and represent various business model-specific objectives, constraints and parameters. Different business models influence not only IPS2 functions and physical modules, but also the types, times and frequency of services, which need to be delivered. The described agent-based model is prototypically implemented. It can be applied as a decision-support system in the design and restructuring of IPS2 networks and for strategic capacity planning decisions. A scenario study is presented to evaluate the simulation approach and to showhow the influence of dynamic business models can be represented in IPS2 network planning.

Abstract: Abstract
The integrated offering of industrial products and services is an important opportunity for companies to differentiate themselves from their competitors and thus increasing their competitiveness. To support the development of the novel solutions, Müller has introduced the PSS development methodology, which proposes different methods for PSS development [2–5]. To introduce these methods into industry an appropriate approach is required. This approach has been developed within the Collaborative Research Center Transregio 29 (CRC TR29) based on the findings of collaboration work with experts in the field of organizational change management, the communication with other CRC TR29 partners and numerous impulses from literature. The approach describes the introduction process, which includes an analysis of the corporate culture, the assignment of the needed knowledge to the involved players, the concrete introduction modules with chosen teaching methods and the establishment of a support organization for the development process. The detailed description of the process of introducing PSS development methodology, its evaluation process and the derived findings will be presented in detail in this paper.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the major features of product-service systems (PSS) design is a variety of design elements. This makes its design process complex and obscure. This study aims to develop a method for analysing how the design process influences the features of design solutions in the conceptual design of PSS. In this study, protocol analysis is applied to plural PSS design sessions. Simultaneously, their design solutions are evaluated relatively based on several aspects. Their design processes are analysed in connection with the above evaluation results. The findings obtained by using the proposed method will contribute to creating practical design guidelines for superior PSS development.

Abstract: Abstract
A key challenge of the 21st century is to transform society into one that features sustainable patterns of production and consumption. To achieve this, transition processes need to be designed in key areas such as housing, mobility and nutrition. The design and large-scale implementation of sustainable product service systems (PSS) is regarded a promising approach for sustainability transitions. Real-life socio-technical experiments are an important infrastructure for designing PSS in collaboration with stakeholders and users. In this paper, we argue that transdisciplinary and action research methods are required for institutionalising an experimental set-up and developing PSS within such infrastructures. We present the Sustainable LivingLabs (SLL) research infrastructure and its methodology as an example of such experimental settings. It was collaboratively developed with key stakeholders in three consecutive research projects and applied to e.g. heating and space heating. We show new qualities of SLL in relation to existing LivingLabs and approaches for PSS design and present its methodological three-phase model (insight research, prototyping, field testing) of research. Our article contributes to knowledge on a methodological framework and tool-kit for PSS development in SLL with a clear focus on socio-ecological sustainability. Intermediate findings confirm the high influence of user practices on heating energy consumption and show starting points for PSS development: e.g. transformational products, home-automation combined with consulting along value chains. We hypothesise that developing PSS in user- and stakeholder-integrated settings supports acceptance and diffusion and, by taking into account users' social practices of utilising novelties, reduces rebound effects caused by incorrect application.

Abstract: Abstract
The spatial distribution and growing granularity of value chains within manufacturing networks increase the complexity of inter-organizational value creation processes and pose new challenges for their coordination and a common innovation development. “Knowledge” is the essential resource to cope with this complexity. However, in an inter-organizational context conflicts between knowledge management objectives and general management objectives can arise, which have to be compensated. The presented article describes the role of a knowledge intermediary, which represents a support function within value creation networks. The intermediary supports value creation structures, processes and the artifact, which ensure an appropriate symbiosis between knowledge management objectives and general management objectives.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to the integration of product and services as a new business model, product reliability and strategies for cost reduction at the early design stage have become important factors for many manufacturing firms. It is, therefore, critical at this phase to analyse the risk involved with Service Requirements noncompliance in order to help designers make informed decisions; as these decisions have a large impact on the Product Life Cycle (PLC).

An investigation has been performed into how Service Requirements are analysed in a service orientated business to achieve reduced Life Cycle Cost (LCC) and improvements of existing Service Requirements. Weibull distribution and Monte Carlo principle have been proposed to do so; as they are considered as the most widely used in product reliability studies in the industry sector. A generic methodology for risk evaluation of failure to deliver a new product against Service Requirements is presented in this paper. This is part of the ongoing research project which aims to, apart from comparing current and targeted Service Requirements, it also facilitates an optimisation of them at the minimum risk of nonconformity.

Abstract: Abstract
Many companies adopt lessons-learned practices to transform gained experiences into useful knowledge for future benefit. Researchers have examined lessons-learned practices in project-based organizations that primarily develop pure products or services in various disciplines and industrial sectors. However, little research exists on the lessons-learned practices in manufacturing companies offering integrated product–service combinations. Therefore, this study performs three case studies in two large manufacturing companies undergoing a servitization journey to becoming product–service providers. The study identifies ten requirements under three main categories—content, process, and technology—for better organized lessons-learned practice. Drawing from the requirements analysis, this study develops a method for representing lessons learned in product–service innovation contexts.

Abstract: Abstract
Functional products (FPs) comprises of integrated hardware, software, and a service support system components that are bundled together to offer higher customer value and possibility to generate revenue. However, offering FPs requires forming and managing win-win collaboration with diverse global value-chain organizations. Based on twenty explorative interviews at two Swedish manufacturing companies, we specifically focus on the collaboration between FP provider and its value-chain delivery organizations. Our result shows that such collaborations can lead to win-lose or lose-win situations. Furthermore, we identify six diverse relational challenges which could negatively influence the collaboration between FP providers and their value-chain delivery organizations.

Abstract: Abstract
Business-to-business Product Service System (PSS) solutions are characterized by intensive interaction among PSS providers, suppliers, and customers, as well as an integration of physical and immaterial solution modules. These factors increase the complexity and interdisciplinary of such offerings. Furthermore, the characteristics complicate sustainability assessment and monitoring of PSS, as environmental, social, and economic concerns have to be integrated into a PSS by minimizing negative impacts of the PSS on these three axes throughout the PSS lifecycle. The indicator-based framework “PSS Sustainability Assessment and Monitoring (PSS-SAM)” has been specifically developed to support managers and decision makers in dealing with the complex situation described above. This framework considers the most important sustainability aspects throughout the entire PSS lifecycle and adheres to European standard requirements. The results of a previous work have already confirmed the usability of the framework to assess the sustainability of one PSS module (availability of spindle) within a single PSS lifecycle phase (operating phase). The aim of this paper is to present the improvements of the PSS-SAM framework that facilitate sustainability assessment of PSS solutions with multiple modules throughout their entire lifecycle. The improved framework has been validated by a case study of an industrial micro-production PSS solution including multiple modules (spindle, maintenance, training, etc.). The long-term goal is to develop IT solutions that support the sustainability assessment of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
The automotive market is currently subject to an unprecedented change. Presently a transformation from the conventional, individual kind of mobility, which was primarily operated by internal combustion engines, to a change of technology, driven by sustainable drive systems such as electric mobility, takes place. By now it is quite ambiguous, which technology within the individual mobility will have great success. However there is a general agreement, that the change of mobility will have strong impacts on the entire supply chain. The scientific discussions are focused mainly on problems in the primary commodity sector such as the development of electric vehicles, the technological core problems (e.g. battery technology) or the infrastructure. However the impacts on the indirect fields and especially the highly profitable automotive aftermarket are to the greatest extent remain unnoticed. In this area, there is a lack of funded reviews and scientific approaches about how to deal with technology shortages and its impacts. All the different Stakeholders operating in the field of the automotive aftermarket will be affected by this change. But in particular for small and medium-sized car repair shops it is not very easy to generate new innovative and extensive strategies next to their day-to-day business. Within this paper the development of a method will be described, which should help the stakeholders of the automotive aftermarket to reconsider their existing strategy and to find alternative strategies to modify their existing strategy. The usage of this method is very simple and does not require a lot of input to be successful in generating acceptable strategic recommendations.

Abstract: Abstract
Bicycles are a desirable form of transportation for many reasons, including the fact that taking a bicycle is environmentally-friendly, economically cost-effective, a way to keep fit and healthy and, on occasions, an enjoyable social activity. This paper explores the characteristics and commonalities between particular bike-sharing systems in urban areas, with a view to deriving influences on the sustainability of such systems. The empirical study is China and the paper analyses bike-sharing systems in five Chinese cities. China is suffering from the severe negative consequences of high private vehicle usage in large and densely populated cities. Nevertheless a long history of bicycle usage in the country provides great potential for such a green form of travel to be part of public and private transportation. The findings show that bike-sharing systems have varying degrees of success. The configurations which seem the most sustainable consider and integrate elements relating to transport planning, system design and choice of business model. Key conclusions are that those responsible for developing policy and practices in relation to bike-sharing systems need to understand the diverse aspects of value for the stakeholders wishing to engage with such a system. Public bicycle sharing, as a Product Service System, needs to be carefully developed to appreciate the quality and timely interplay between the physical design of the system and the provision of services being offered.

Abstract: Abstract
Eco-innovation research pays increasing attention to business models and their contribution to the diffusion of environmental technology into socio-technical systems. The extent to which a business model hampers or promotes certain types of eco-innovations remains an open question. In order to shed light on this issue, the authors develop a conceptual framework to show how a specific type of business model (Product-Service Systems) could be applied to the context of the maritime industry. With a focus on the Danish maritime industry, the case study addresses two questions: Which business models are being used to develop, install and service the ballast water treatment technology? And, How can these business models add value to the ballast water treatment systems in the market? The case shows that different business models are applied depending on whether the installation is on new or retrofitted vessels. Both installation and operation stages of ballast water treatment systems provide opportunities for collaboration among stakeholders. Based on the Eco-costs/Value Ratio model, the authors perform an analysis of on-board and port-based ballast water treatment systems with the aim to propose a possible product-service system. These results suggest that port-based systems have the highest potential for eco-efficient value creation and a possible product-service system can be designed for this kind of technology. The article highlights the point that authorities need to improve regulations to stimulate port-based ballast water treatment systems rather than on-board ballast management systems.

Abstract: Abstract
The evaluation of a Product-Service System (PSS), particularly during its design phase but also throughout its lifecycle, is a challenging problem. It exhibits dynamic nature and is multidimensional, since a large network of stakeholders are usually involved in the design and development of PSS eco-systems and their influence must be considered during the evaluation of the PSS offering. Nevertheless, an effective PSS evaluation can determine the market success of the PSS offering, leading to fewer design modifications and shortened time-to-market. Still, existing literature lacks an exhaustive review and classification of PSS evaluation approaches. Moreover, a lack of critical in-depth validation of performance approaches in real industrial environments is observed. Towards bridging this gap, the present work identifies the most important perspectives in the PSS ecosystem, such as supplier selection and service level, and discusses the utilised evaluation approaches used for each of them. Based on this review, a classification of existing PSS evaluation approaches is provided, by mapping these PSS eco-system perspectives to the methods most frequently used for their evaluation. The results can be used as guidelines for PSS vendors to select the most suitable method for the evaluation of their PSS offerings.

Abstract: Both the Product-Service System (PSS) literature and industry express a need to close the design loop by using product-in-use data to inform PSS Conceptual Design. Nevertheless, how to actually accomplish this is largely unknown. This research makes use of the literature as well as findings from interviews and case studies with industry as the basis for a framework which could utilise system-in-use (rather than just product-in-use) data from in-service records and receiver needs regarding the use of large, capital-intensive, technical assets to generate solutions which could aid the conception of PSS at the Conceptual Design stage.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the most critical elements in the ‘productisation’ of service adopted by today's aero-engine Maintenance Repair and Overhaul (MRO) companies is the match between customer demands and the operational capabilities of the MRO shop. Currently, the service contract is offered based upon experience and intuition rather than on scientific approach. This paper presents an integrated decision making framework to design contracts that considers demand and operational parameters. In addition to literature survey, the approach adopted in building the framework is a case study research, which obtains data from semi-structured interviews, observations and the company archives. Two main perspectives, dynamic operational parameters and shop floor operational parameters, were identified as essential and pertinent to the design and management of the service contract in the productisation context. The framework will incorporate both perspectives to support productisation.

Abstract: In the global market, heavy construction machinery manufacturers are transforming their business from selling products to providing services based on their products, i.e. transforming to Product-Service Systems (PSS) business model. This business transformation requires manufacturers to learn past design experience not only on the product design, but also on the product usage and maintenance. Effective knowledge and information management systems can help the business to obtain and reuse the past knowledge in new product design. This study aims to develop an integrated knowledge management and reuse framework for Product-Service Systems business in construction machinery industry. The prototype of such a knowledge management and reuse system has been developed and initially validated. The research shows that the developed knowledge management and reuse system can effectively help Product-Service Systems design for construction machinery.

Abstract: Abstract
In recent years, the economic and financial crises have been slowing down the growth of international markets. The resulting necessity to increase competitiveness has forced manufacturing industries to rethink their offer portfolio, also implementing servitization strategies. In particular, given the dramatic raise of customers’ awareness as regards environmental and energy problems, the energy industry is also considering the provision of Product-Service System (PSS) solutions (i.e. the bundle of energy services to energy efficiency related products) as a profitable alternative. However, the design of PSS and in particular of the service content of the offer is a challenging activity, mainly due to the fact that services are by definition characterized by high level of intangibility and perishability, and to the fact that standard tools and methodologies for service engineering are not available. The SErvice Engineering Methodology (SEEM) [1] aims at supporting companies in these design and implementation phases. The methodology is in its development phase and its applicability in industry has been mainly tested in one specific context. This paper deals with the application of SEEM in the context of Energy Services (ESs) where the design phase can be much more complex than in other areas due to the variety of industries offering this kind of services and to the number of stakeholders involved during the service provision. In particular, this paper refers to a specific ES (the provision of data elaboration and analysis to energy consumption monitoring and control purposes) marketed together with energy meters. The general aim of this work is to provide a first analysis and a general understanding of the applicability of this existing methodology to the ES field by the mean of a real case study. In the paper, main steps of the application of the SEEM to the case study are described and discussed, to highlight main criticalities. In the end, a critical analysis is provided in order to put the basis to generalize the insights of this work to additional Energy Services.

Abstract: Abstract
Significant investments in productivity improvement approaches over the past two decades have been embedded in ‘lean’ principles and philosophies within the manufacturing sector. Although the manufacturing sector has focused on offering integrated bundles of physical goods and services via product-service systems with lean principles and philosophies, there has been considerably less adoption of lean methodologies in the service sector. Hence, it is vital to investigate the application potential of lean principles in service processes’ productivity improvement. This manus cript presents the results of a case study performed to improve the service performance of a firm providing plain old telephone services (POTS). The firm provides, among other things, telecommunication related ‘voice-grade telephone services’ employing analog signal transmission over copper loops. The analysis methodology contains tailor-made value stream mapping (VSM) and value stream analysis (VSA), which has been carried out to investigate the current state of the value adding [also including non-value adding (not essential) and non-value adding (essential)] activities involved in the POTS related tasks. A current state value stream map (CSVS-Map) has been developed and VSA has been performed. Based on the CSVS-Map and the results of VSA, a future state value stream map (FSVS-Map) has been developed. Finally, the resulting improved performance of the POTS related tasks has been presented. The goal of this paper was to identify the advantages of implementing lean tools in service processes in the example of the described case study. The main obtained advantages are a 50% decrease in service lead time, which gives the capability to deliver almost double the amount of POTS installation service.

Abstract: Abstract
In the past few decades, e-waste has emerged as one of the fastest growing and increasingly complex waste flows world-wide. Within e-waste, the life cycle of the mobile phone product system is particularly important because of: (1) the increasing quantities of mobile phones in this waste flow; and (2) the sustainability challenges associated with the emerging economies of reuse, refurbishment, and export of used mobile phones. This study examined the possibilities of closing the material flow loop in the global mobile phone product system (GMPPS) while addressing the broad sustainability challenges linked to recovery of materials. This was done using an adapted system dynamics modeling approach to investigate the dominant paths and drivers for closing the metal flow loop through the concept of eco-cycle. Two indicators were chosen to define the closed loop system: loop leakage and loop efficiency. Sensitivity analysis of selected parameters was used to identify potential drivers for closing the metal flow loop. The modeling work indicated leverage for management strategies aimed at closing the loop in: (i) collection systems for used phones, (ii) mobile phone use time, and (ii) informal recycling in developing countries. By analyzing the dominant parameters, an eco-cycle scenario that could promote a closed loop system by decreasing pressures on virgin materials was formulated. Improved policy support and product service systems could synchronize growth between upstream producers and end-of-life organizations and help achieve circular production and consumption in the GMPPS.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents an approach on how multimodality and wearable technology can be used to design an innovative device for maintenance assistance of human operators in Industrial Product-Service Systems (IPS2). Based on findings from wearable computing technology and multimodality in warning design, the concept and prototypic realization of a multimodal action-specific warning glove is introduced. This glove provides visual, auditory and haptic feedback. To test the glove's usability the maintenance scenario “changing a spindle” was used. The results of the short version of the ISONORM 9241/110 questionnaire encourage further improvements of the warning glove.

Abstract: Abstract
In order to achieve successful product-service system (PSS) development and commercialization, a methodical approach is inevitable. This approach must be conducted in the development and testing processes of system components as well as in the entire system. Innovative solutions have to gain a high maturity in a minimum time period to put advantages over competitors into practice before they are outdated. In India, distributions of solar home systems are spreading dynamically, but are facing problems in their customer relations. Planning, installation and maintenance of the systems are all weak points in this field. Throughout this project called MEVIS, an integrated solution was developed in order to eliminate these problems: an innovative charge controller as well as an information system, which are both technical components of a business- to-business service solution. In addition to the technical function of the charge controller, the added value is achieved through the accessibility of employees to information, enabling them to more efficiently carry out processes by supporting their decision making or planning according to their individual roles. The overall design was carried out utilizing PSS development methods, elaborated at Fraunhofer IPK and TU Berlin, in order to enable a company to become a PSS provider. During the development process, the evaluation was carried out at several stages. According to the PSS V-model development, results have been tested at an early stage by a proof-of-concept and agent-based simulation technologies. The detailed modeling of components, actors and the environment in the design stage facilitate the creation of the simulation model. This represents the first virtual integration of the various domains in the development after the PSS V-model. With this integrated system model, extensive studies regarding the interaction of the components during the business processes can be conducted along various stages of the development process. The final field test of the overall system was conducted in Bangalore, India. The selected partner, Selco Foundation, has vast experience in distributing solar home systems and carries out all lifecycle activities on itself. To solve their problems in solar energy distribution, the partner uses the developed charge controller and gets the aggregated information according to the needs of the relevant service. The findings from the application of methods of development, evaluation and testing are described in this paper. It analyzes how the provider was enabled to make the transition from a service provider to a PSS provider. The analysis also evaluates how these methods have the power to support future providers to bring innovative business ideas for integrated solutions to a high maturity without having years of experience in PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
In the sheet metal industry, single machines or more complex production systems are integrated with a software needed to control them. While it is clear both for the company and the client that the machine is a product offered with the related services, the software deserves more attention. In the company where our team has been involved in an action research program, the software is conceived as a product with its related services, but this concept has not been properly transmitted to clients, who don’t recognize it and pretend software services for free. In this industry, machinery is linked to its software and both are enhanced by the related services, so the final product-service bundle should be made by four components.

In order to better clarify this concept and illustrate the solutions our research team has identified to promote a complete PSS offer, the four-leg chair metaphor is proposed. The proper value of the whole PSS offer can be transmitted by an effective communication process, supporting sales people with instruments such as predefined packets for software services. Organisational changes should be adopted such as job enlargement for software technicians and cross-training with salespeople. By the former, software technicians, who are frontline employees in direct contact with customers during the training phase, can be transformed into internal entrepreneurs by proper incentives. Since they lack marketing education and sometimes trust of salespeople, cross-training is proposed as an effective way to keep in touch software technicians with salespeople with mutual learning.

Abstract: The concept of sustainable product-service systems has emerged recently, and is distinct from the ideas of cleaner production, eco-design and design for the environment. The concept goes beyond the environmental optimisation of products and processes and requires radical and creative thinking to reduce environmental impacts by a factor of between four and 20 times while maintaining an acceptable quality of service. Sustainable product-services consider alternative socio-technical systems that can provide the essential end-use function, such as warmth or mobility, that an existing product offers. Four types are outlined—result services; shared utilisation services; product-life extension services; and demand side management. Sustainable product-service systems attempt to create designs that are sustainable in terms of environmental burden and resource use, whilst developing product concepts as parts of sustainable whole systems, that provide a service or function to meet essential needs.

Abstract: Abstract
By representing the servitization of three leading corporations via a strategy map, this multiple-case study discusses how the strategic logic of servitization can be explained by linking the key practices adopted by manufacturers to support critical processes while shifting their focus to project-based customer solutions. The results draw on data collected from solution providers operating in the metal and machinery industries headquartered in Finland. By examining the strategic actions, tools, and processes behind the implementation of servitization, this study extends recent debates on the service-based business models of manufacturing companies. For servitization theory, this study develops a strategy map for a solution provider. For manufacturing firms, this study provides a framework and a tool for benchmarking, developing and implementing a strategy while mitigating the processes of long-term value creation and appropriation.

Abstract: This paper presents the findings of an investigation into the industry practice of service delivery within microsystems technologies (MST) (also known as micro-electro-mechanical systems, MEMS) production. A study was undertaken to evaluate 100 MST companies that deliver integrated products and services i.e. a product-service system (PSS).

The aim of the study is to: (i) analyse the main types of services delivered by MST companies, and (ii) make recommendations for improving MST production. The PSS approach to production and manufacturing is introduced and used to evaluate the current state of service delivery within MST production. The findings of the study are then used to make recommendations for improving future MST production.

Abstract: Abstract
Academic interests in the product-service system have shifted from the area of environmental sustainability to the socio-economic issues. In this context, life cycle assessment is no longer the only approach to interpreting the performances of product-service systems. Multiple criteria reflecting product-service quality, customer satisfaction, and the full sustainability concerns would be needed to evaluate the system solutions. In this paper, a concept of sustainable product-service efficiency is proposed to explore the relationship between product-service value and the sustainability impact. Additionally, the authors discuss how this concept can be applied to assess sustainable product-service systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Providing maintenance and services for high value complex products would extend manufacturers’ responsibilities and benefits to the products’ whole usable life, and provide the opportunities to re-use or re-manufacture some failed parts. Sophisticated Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine tools in modern manufacturing systems are special products in that they are also used to manufacture other products, and their operation performance directly affects the quality of the manufactured parts as well as the performance of the entire manufacturing system. To ensure CNC machine tools’ consistent performance, appropriate and efficient maintenance and services are essential and this is more challenging as technologies become more sophisticated and the environment is more dynamic. Previous research was mainly focused on maintenance strategy and maintenance scheduling. Very little effort was devoted to providing operational guidance for maintenance process execution, i.e., providing service suppliers with detailed information about resources needed for maintenance such as tooling, consumables, materials and spare parts, as well as service steps including disassembly and assembly of the serviced products. In this project, planning maintenance operation sequences, schedules and resource allocation are the three main tasks for generating final maintenance plans. This paper will present a Collaborative Maintenance Planning System (CoMPS) which will manage information and knowledge to support decision making in maintenance process planning.

Abstract: Abstract
Approximately 80% of the costs of Product-Service-Systems (PSS) operation are labor costs. A service company's employeesare their most important input factor, which therefore strongly defines the success of PSS operation, in particular this applies to PSS for the product usage life cycle phase. Consequently, it is very important to assign tasks to employees within a service project very much based on their abilities and the challenges of the tasks. This allows a sustainable use of the most important resource within PSS operation.

The idea of human reliability is well established. Like for technical systems, the calculation of reliability is the basis for defining the error probability for a specific worker/ group of worker within a certain process step. Within PSS operation the human reliability is not only dependent on the individual capabilities but is also very much related to the serviced product. Analyzing the relevant man-machine-systems is therefore essential when reaching for sustainability in service operation.

The concept of the human reliability within a PSS defines the human probability of error by the strain of a service task. The strain is dependent on the task (its processes and (technical) tool use) and the individual capabilities of the employee. The industrial psychology has identified several factors describing the stress of a task and the human abilities. Due to research within PSS operation the general idea of the relation between strain and stress can be extended to a service-strain-stress model (SSSM) which has to be seen as a qualitative framework for a classification of service employees based on the service tasks on one hand and the different individual abilities of the employee on the other hand. The SSSM allows to assign service tasks to a worker/ group of worker without exceeding a certain individual strain level and therefore to reduce the probability of error realizing a sustainable service operation.

This paper outlines the idea of categorizing service operations employees according to the individual abilities, the product complexity and the time pressure within a strongly customer oriented service project. Due to the qualitative, individual characteristics of employees, the categories defined will be rather qualitative.The model can be used for a more sustainable planning of a service company's manpower or as a tool for optimizing the supply of temporary workers in the service domain. But could also work as a benchmark for service personnel management.

Abstract: Abstract
This study investigated the effects of carbon footprint (CFP) labels on consumer purchase decision-making. CFP labels generally provide information related to the amount of CO2 emissions during production, use, and final disposal of a product. For this study, human participant experiments were conducted using the experimental economics method. The experiment particularly examines whether CFP labels are attached to products or not, additionally considering the information disclosure of the relation between CO2 emissions and environmental damage and other consumers’ purchasing behavior. Results show the following: 1) when the information is open, it is better to attach CFP labels to both the environmentally friendly product and the less-friendly product; 2) when the information is closed, it is better to attach CFP labels only to the environmentally friendly product; 3) when CFP labels are attached to both products, it is better to give open the information. These results suggest that if CFP labels cover all products in the near future, they should provide information related to environmental damage as well as CO2 emissions, which can be expected to motivate consumers to purchase environmentally friendly products.

Abstract: In mechanical engineering and plant design, product-related services are usually considered as an add-on to the actual product. Industrial Product-Service Systems deal with dynamic interdependencies of products and services in production. Research areas cover new concepts and methods which enable the machine producers to design the potential services in an optimal way, already during the development of the machine. This paradigm shift from the separated consideration of products and services to a new product understanding consisting of integrated products and services creates innovation potential to increase the sustainable competitiveness of mechanical engineering and plant design. The latter allows business models which do not focus on the machine sales but on the use for the customer e.g. in form of continuously available machines. The business model determines the complexity of delivery processes. Characteristics of Industrial Product-Service Systems allow covering all market demands.

Abstract: Product Service Systems (PSS) designers are increasingly signaling the importance of emotion. However, emotion is yet to be theoretically and empirically studied in PSS design. This paper offers a conceptual model as well as an in-depth field study of the design of an emotion-centred PSS. While the analysis is inductive, it draws on related concepts from structural appraisal theory and structuration theory to further conceptualise the findings. The notion of ‘emotional chain reactions’ in the stimulation of user agency is put forward, producing implications for PSS design theory and practice. For the latter we suggest an emotion-based blueprinting technique.

Abstract: Abstract
An important step towards achieving sustainability is to encourage a wide uptake of more resource-efficient consumption practices by the mainstream of society. However, consumption practices are complexly interlinked with cultural values, social status, identity and other symbolic aspects of socio-economic paradigms. Historically, design has played an important role in changing well-established cultural practices by leveraging the introduction of new technologies, or legitimising values, beliefs and social practices through its representations. In this paper, it is argued that focussing on the elaboration of meanings – or symbolic features – during the design process of sustainable innovations can enhance their wider appeal, especially by positioning them as aspirational choices that contribute to the well-being and happiness of potential users. But, in order to strategically elaborate such meanings, it becomes necessary to identify the favourable social conventions at play in a given context – i.e. the best cultural codes upon which to successfully build an innovation's relevance and desirability. Semiotic and cultural analysis methods pose great potential for supporting design in this task. In this paper, an initial methodological framework for the incorporation of these methods in the design process is proposed. The theoretical proposition is explored in the context of sustainable Product Service Systems (sustainable PSS), given the opportunities they pose for systemic disruption as radical innovations and the cultural barriers for their mainstream adoption. This contribution, thus, not only offers a new theoretical perspective for considering the symbolic aspects of sustainable consumption as social signifier; but also provides a practical framework that incorporates a socio-cultural lens to user research in design practice. It also highlights the strategic opportunities that this field of enquiry opens for sustainable design to have a wider influence in societal transformation.

Abstract: Abstract
Re-use implies recovering items from the waste stream to use them in identical or similar processes, mostly at consumer level. Currently, re-use is restricted to niches, but by 2020 the European Commission wants to mainstream re-use as a waste management option to increase resource efficiency. Ecologically oriented work integration social enterprises focussing on re-use (re-use ECO-WISEs) might help accomplish as they not only intend to re-integrate marginalised people into the labour market, but provide comprehensive re-use services (e.g. repair) and thus constitute a novel kind of Sustainable Product–Service System (SPSS). This paper contributes to a scientific framework for re-use ECO-WISEs by linking existing theoretical knowledge on SPSS to novel knowledge from three cases representing the variety of re-use ECO-WISEs in Austria. For analysis we use the so-called Business Model Canvas, adding a comprehensive stakeholder consideration. Results show that re-use ECO-WISEs contribute to all three dimensions of sustainability by helping reduce waste and increasing resource productivity and by providing jobs and affordable goods for disadvantaged people. Full implementation, however, will need additional efforts from all stakeholders involved, including the ECO-WISEs themselves, but also public authorities and society at large.

Abstract: Abstract
Which business models create maximum value for customers by leveraging the synergies between electric vehicles, installed batteries, photovoltaic systems, and the power grid? Both the solar power generation and the number of electric vehicles are massively increasing in the forthcoming years and thus they have to be respected as irreversible trends. Assuming that the combination of those technologies through a cooperative energy management approach allows entrepreneurs to make superior value propositions and to generate competitive advantages, a framework is proposed to figure out several business model prototypes. To quickly assess the dynamic behavior and the profitability of those prototypes in an innovation process the framework is complemented by a System Dynamics simulation model.

Abstract: Manufacturing industries has confronted a changing phase from sales as physical products to provision as ‘servicized’ products. Accordingly, manufacturers must consider a new fusional framework incorporating products and services. This study defines a ‘platform-type product service system’ as a comprehensive business model with a common platform on which service providers, consumers, and manufacturers mutually interact. Such a platform framework offers great potential for manufacturers because it inevitably requires product use. Our study categorizes actual business examples. Then, based on that categorization, we construct theoretical models of several types. Game theoretic analysis clarifies its characteristics and mechanisms.

Abstract: Abstract
Recently, lots of manufacturing companies have been attracted by the possibility to differentiate themselves from competitors introducing product related services in their traditional portfolio. During this transition, however, companies are not properly supported by proper methods and tools. In particular, the majority of the approaches addressing the PSS design are limiting their field of application only to “service design” and are specifically focusing on requirements generation and identification phases of the design process. Few of the approaches analysed contribute to concept development and evaluation phases and if so, they just address one of the two phases. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to propose the Product-Service Concept Tree (PSCT) method. This aims at suggesting a possible structure to identify, collect possible PSS solutions and manage their assessment (i.e. the selection of the best PSS to implement). Furthermore, it includes guidelines to lead industrial practitioners in easily use it. An application of the proposed method is also presented to demonstrate its industrial applicability.

Abstract: Abstract
An increasing number of Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) are realizing that their products, earlier the foundation of their success, no longer stand alone in satisfying customer requirements. Customers now demand integration of services and bundling as well as increased active participation of OEMs during the use phase. Ericsson, a Swedish multinational OEM of communications technology and services, is an example of such a company. The objective of this paper is to describe, compare and discuss Ericsson's journey from a product provider to a PSS provider, e.g. by comparison with other industry examples. Furthermore, the paper highlights future challenges and opportunities for instance regarding business models, trends and product design.

Abstract: Abstract
The individualization and customization of products is one the most important trends for industrial companies. New technologies like additive manufacturing (e. g. 3D-printing) are enablers for the further development of this trend. Companies offering production systems for those technologies are more and more required to embed Industrial Product Service Systems (IPSS) to assert theirselves on the market.

The aim of this research is to develop a business model which evaluates process costs of additive manufacturing technologies. The relevant technologies are Stereolithography, Selective Laser Melting, Fused Deposition Modeling, Selective Laser Melting, Electron Beam Melting and Laser Cladding. Product costs can be calculated easily and the outcome of the evaluation will serve as a valuable decision base for industrial decision makers on how to invest in a special technology. By embedding this service in the production system/ machines software, a big step for a new industrial service is provided.

The paper is structured in four steps. Firstly, based on a detailed description of the state of the art research, an analysis of the most important process steps in additive manufacturing is presented. A new business model for additive manufacturing technologies is introduced afterwards including the implementation of this business model in a software tool. Furthermore case studies for different product types and product quantities are explained and detailed values for process costs are provided. In the last step, a sensitivity analysis is done to find the most important parameters (cost drivers) for those case studies.

The business model and the evaluation of cost structures for additive manufacturing technologies is unique in the field of IPSS. Using a cost and investment calculation, the companies can significantly increase the effort and quality of price calculations for their products. Furthermore cost drivers are evaluated and recommendations for technology related investments are given.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing companies are increasingly offering add-on services and functional products (FPs) to secure their future competitiveness. For product oriented organizations, this represents a significant transition in their business models, leading to several risks and uncertainties. In this study, we attempt to identify and understand these potential risks that can hinder manufacturing companies from offering FPs. To reach the stated purpose, we have adopted a quantitative research approach and undertaken eighteen explorative interviews in two large Swedish manufacturing companies. Our results show ten potential risks that can negatively affect manufacturing companies. For example, contractual risks, breakdown or technical risk and inappropriate organizational structural risk were found to be the most prominent risks for FPs. These risks are categorized into three specific dimensions related to business models, namely value creation, value delivery and value capture. Thus, the study provides critical understanding towards how manufacturing companies can be better prepared for transforming into a successful FP provider through mitigating of identified FP risks.

Abstract: This paper discusses innovative “Plug-and-Play” scalable gateways using RFID devices and establishing a Gateway Product Service System (GPSS) framework for cost-effective deployment of RFID-enabled manufacturing solutions. A unique contribution is that the GPSS overcomes “three high problems”, namely high cost, high risk and high level of technical skills through a shift from individual investments in RFID devices and skills to common sharing of real-time visibility and traceability services among manufacturing alliance members. This approach substantially reduces start-up investment costs, reduces level of required specialist skills, speeds up installation processes and streamlines maintenance services, and improves sustainable success of RFID adopted projects.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper will summarize the authors’ experience over the last decades, from new methods developed and used within Product Development, as well as current trends. Hence a general and broad overview is presented, rather than recent research results.

Driving forces in PD are: Technology, Market and Society. Ecological, economic and social sustainability require recycling, reuse, energy conservation and new business concepts. Customization is carried out by modular architecture, combining customer specific products with volume production of components and sub-systems. PD integrates “hard” properties (engineering), with “soft” properties (industrial design). Fundamental PD characteristics are: Iteration, Integration (technical and organizational), and Innovation. Globally distributed industrial partners co-operate using Internet. Iteration: process loops are speeded up by modeling/simulation, virtual prototyping and additive manufacturing. Structured PD: Initial specification of “what” – functional requirements, then “how” - generation of design solutions. Interdependencies analysis is important to simplify the product's structure. The V-model for specification and verification is commonly used. A 3-stage industrial process separates strategy, core technology development, and product design for market introduction.

Abstract: Abstract
As organisations become richer in data the function of asset management will have to increasingly use intelligent systems to control condition monitoring systems and organise maintenance. In the future the UK rail industry is anticipating having to optimize capacity by running trains closer to each other. In this situation maintenance becomes extremely problematic as within such a high-performance network a relatively minor fault will impact more trains and passengers; such denial of service causes reputational damage for the industry and causes fines to be levied against the infrastructure owner, Network Rail.

Intelligent systems used to control condition monitoring systems will need to optimize for several factors; optimization for minimizing denial of service will be one such factor. With schedules anticipated to be increasingly complicated detailed estimation methods will be extremely difficult to implement. Cost prediction of maintenance activities tend to be expert driven and require extensive details, making automation of such an activity difficult. Therefore a stochastic process will be needed to approach the problem of predicting the denial of service arising from any required maintenance. Good uncertainty modelling will help to increase the confidence of estimates.

This paper seeks to detail the challenges that the UK Railway industry face with regards to cost modelling of maintenance activities and outline an example of a suitable cost model for quantifying cost uncertainty. The proposed uncertainty quantification is based on historical cost data and interpretation of its statistical distributions. These estimates are then integrated in a cost model to obtain accurate uncertainty measurements of outputs through Monte-Carlo simulation methods. An additional criteria of the model was that it be suitable for integration into an existing prototype integrated intelligent maintenance system. It is anticipated that applying an integrated maintenance management system will apply significant downward pressure on maintenance budgets and reduce denial of service. Accurate cost estimation is therefore of great importance if anticipated cost efficiencies are to be achieved. While the rail industry has been the focus of this work, other industries have been considered and it is anticipated that the approach will be applicable to many other organisations across several asset management intensive industries.

Abstract: Abstract
Projects to deliver Overhead Line Equipment (OLE) electrification on the UK rail infrastructure system presents technical challenges which the rail industry in Britain have not traditionally had to consider. Whole Life Cycle assessment provides decision makers with cost estimates for the installation phase and over the entire service life of the system, including disposal. The OLE projects face a particular problem when analysing the best option for overbridges. Much of the rail infrastructure has not traditionally had to consider overhead clearances and therefore many of the bridges are only a little taller than the rolling stock. In addition to the difficulties in assessing the Life-Cycle costs of assets that have historically been used in very limited scales, the Whole Life Cycle assessment must consider the various engineering options that are available for projects. The three competing options (bridge rebuild, track lowering, reduced clearance) are all going to have very different capital expenditure (CAPEX) and operating expenditure (OPEX) costs. This work presents a model created to predict these costs over the anticipated assessment period. The developed model predicts capital expenditures, maintenance and service disruption costs and links them to the three major assets options involved in OLE underbridges.

Abstract: Abstract
In many countries across the world a universal issue of growing concern is increasing demand for health services and corresponding escalating costs. While there are many reasons for these two trends, reasonable solutions are nowhere in sight and a subject of heated debates. One potential source of relief for the health care systems is to shift some (if not majority – but in long term) of responsibilities to patients themselves. To do so effectively, however, better definition of personal well-being is needed, supported by medical knowledge transfer to the consumer and creation of some personal health management tools. Service engineering concepts, such as service package, are useful in decoupling all elements needed to develop an infrastructure in support of wellness as a core product and addressed by variety of limited-focus services.

This paper reviews the emerging health care paradigms, in particular health care networks, consumer-personalized medicine and quantified self-tracking. With the Quantified Self movement on the rise for the past several years and a corresponding growth in offering of tools for variety of personal data collection (both hardware- and software-based), the obvious question arises how effective they are and what impact they actually have. The discussion also addresses the question whether it is possible to reframe the personal health issues by applying both design thinking and service engineering approaches aimed at individual's own well-being.

Abstract: The paper presents the testing activity of a color-coded 3D visualization approach, developed to enhance the designers' awareness during the conceptual design of a Product Service System (PSS). Protocol analysis is applied to eight design sessions to compare the behavior of different design teams when featuring printouts of color-coded CAD models, instead of spreadsheets with numerical tables, as carrier of value-related information. The analysis focuses on the time spent on the different activities during the sessions, highlighting the problem solving strategies and the consideration of PSS related aspects. The analysis shows that design teams featuring printouts of color-coded CAD models made a more extensive use of information during problem analysis, following a more structured design process, than teams using spreadsheets.

Abstract: Abstract
In this paper a Cluster Reference Framework is introduced in order to give a complete model for an industrial network useful, to give keywords to a manager for the analysis of the industrial network and the decision making process. During the development of the EU project CODESNET, a big number of data of industrial district have been collected and analyzed. From that data, it has been possible to introduce a classification of the network's type and to identify the main components of the model of an industrial network. A graphical three dimensional representation of the cluster model has been presented and used in order to give, to a manager that aims to cluster, a tool for a decision making process based on a sufficient view of the cluster main characteristics.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper shows how a provider of complex hardware with long operation times makes use of a structured methods approach to develop maintenance, repair and overhaul services and improve its service solutions.Service engineering is a methodical approach for the design of service offerings, and can be described by using the dimensions outcome, structure, processand management. So far, little is known about how firms implement such approaches. On the basis of a longitudinal case study within a large, product-based, high-technology business corporation, the paper shows that the use of a simplified service engineering model may be effective in supporting both the development and the maintenance of a comprehensive service business. More specifically, the case suggests the following factors to be important for success: A systematically applied engineering method, the presence of dedicated service champions, an ability to articulate and formalize new service roles, and deep technical knowledge of the involved hardware.

Abstract: A shift in business thinking from selling products to providing service solutions to customer needs is becoming noticeable. It is driven by increasing competition and the need to identify new profit centres for producers of mature products. This paper identifies a new product group that could be interesting from the product-service system perspective – baby prams. The study presents a new business model based on selling the function that baby prams provide through leasing prams. It discusses potential barriers and necessary changes in product design and the supply chain to make it work. The product-service system in this case could include the organisation of a reverse logistics system with different levels of refurbishment and remanufacturing of prams, partially by retailers. The new model may provide customers with a high quality pram in a “like new” condition for the period they need it, and may help avoid transaction costs of having to sell the pram on the second-hand market. Economic estimations point to a significant potential for increased profits, while the environmental potential should be further investigated.

Abstract: Abstract
Today's automotive market is a highly competitive industry as many global manufacturing enterprises are competing to increase and dominate more market shares. Automotive and other major manufacturers must focus on three points: product diversification to satisfy customer demands, increase market share globally and domestically, and reduce design and manufacturing cost. Enterprises must understand current and future customer expectations as perceptions evolve overtime. Product platform and products family strategies have been implemented widely to offer variations. Assessing diversification in product platforms and product families is a tool used to support and create the most effective balance between market demands and product diversifications.

Redundancy in product features, functions, and options generates self-competition. The focus of this research is to identify the ultimate number of product platforms of existing and prospective products of an enterprise. The proposed mathematical model will introduce indexes to evaluate current products diversification and degree of diversification, With respect to market share, The Indexes are designed to identify the appropriate number of product platforms needed for the market to reduce cost and increase revenue. The developed mathematical model is demonstrated and validated using case studies from actual industry data.

Abstract: Abstract
It has become an important trend in the manufacturing industry that service is used to enhance the competitiveness of businesses as well as an important source of values. Aiming to extend the achievements of product configuration in manufacturing industry to service industry, an ontology-based product–service configuration approach is presented in this paper. Firstly, value attributes of product–service are defined based on the analysis of customer demands. And the demand cluster method is proposed to identify value demands of customers. Secondly, the modular system of product–service is established which is the basis of building product–service ontology. Thirdly, the product–service configuration method based on ontology modeling is put forward. Finally, the proposed approach to product–service configuration is demonstrated by an example of configuring service packages of civil aircraft materials.

Abstract: Abstract
In the globally competitive market landscape, companies, in order to remain sustainable, must shift their focus towards constantly improving their PSS offerings by incorporating lean thinking approaches. PSS are complex, dynamic, and multi-dimensional systems, which are supported by appropriate infrastructure and networks. At the same time, PSS require robust engineering methods and tools for their design, which allow multi-dimensional exchange of knowledge between the designers and the relevant stakeholders across the value chain. Currently, enabling technologies such as Cloud technology, social media and networking, knowledge management, and context sensitivity present new possibilities to enhance the knowledge exchange and the collaborative process of PSS design. These technologies allow the gathering and analysis of big volumes of data from scattered heterogeneous IT systems and, at the same time, allow PSS design improvements by processing the experiences of the business customers, consumers, designers, shop-floor, and provide feedback to the design phase. However, a number of challenges are encountered during the gathering, visualization, monitoring, and assessment of related data, such as the lack of context sensitivity. Simultaneously, PSS evaluation approaches are still immature and there is limited work that correlates the impact of the entire PSS lifecycle with the performance assessment of the PSS design. The present work includes a review of the aforementioned technologies from academic, market, and industrial perspectives. Based on an extensive literature review and on constructive discussions with three European SMEs, several barriers and limitations of adopting the aforementioned technologies in practice are identified. Finally, a conceptual eco-innovative framework for lean PSS design is presented, explaining how these technologies could be combined for the improvements of PSS design and evaluation procedures.

Abstract: Abstract
Emerging from a study in the European aerospace industry, this paper identifies a gap in the way value-related information is communicated to designers of hardware in the preliminary stages of Product Service System (PSS) design. To fit this gap a Lifecycle Value Representation Approach, named LiVReA, that uses color-coded 3D CAD models to enable value information to be translated into visual features, is presented. Such approach aims at enhancing designers' awareness of the value contribution of an early design concept on the overall PSS offer by complementing requirements-based information with criteria reflecting the fulfillment of customers and system value. The paper details the development of the approach, its underlying rationale, the results of preliminary validation activities and the potential for industrial application in the light of the currently available PSS representation tools.

Abstract: The Product–Service System (PSS) concept has been proposed as a promising avenue to achieve sustainable consumption and production patterns and to improve the competitiveness of industrial manufacturers. The adoption of a PSS involves an orientation toward selling product functionality instead of selling products. Two aspects in the available PSS literature need to be refined. On the one hand it is crucial to achieve a systematic treatment of the notion of function, which is of central importance to the PSS concept. On the other hand the common PSS typology that distinguishes between product-oriented, use-oriented and result-oriented PSS needs to be revisited, as this categorization fails to capture the complexity of PSS examples found in practice. In this article a new functional decomposition technique, termed Functional Hierarchy Modeling (FHM), is proposed. This technique allows to analyze and represent the function(s) of an investment good within the customer's environment. It gives rise to a novel PSS typology based on the level of integration and the performance orientation of the dominant revenue mechanism within the PSS. Both FHM and the new PSS typology contribute to PSS theory by offering a framework instrumental in understanding the essential characteristics of a particular PSS and in designing a varied set of PSS options for a manufacturer of investment goods. Throughout the paper, this is illustrated with industrial examples.

Abstract: Abstract
The search for flexibility in the new product development (NPD) entails an increasing need for integration of services and products (servitization). Hence, companies aim at maximizing the customer perceived value, which may demand new capabilities development, besides marketing, engineering and manufacturing. This paper suggests that the ‘customer service’ functional area has a central role in this context, since it deals with customers’ problems in a front-end position, and its knowledge can help other functional areas to develop required capabilities for servitization. Moreover, the level of knowledge transfer (KT) among different functional areas is also proposed as an essential activity to improve the servitization process. Thus, the aim of this paper is to investigate the moderator role of both the customer service area and the KT activities in the impact of the NPD related functional areas on servitization performance. For this purpose, the paper presents a cross-industry survey with 83 Brazilian companies, analyzed by means of an Ordinary Least Square (OLS) regression. Results show that the last border to transcend the servitization barriers in NPD is the integration of the customer service area to the other main functional areas of NPD. Moreover, our findings indicate which areas are the most critical ones in order to address an intensive KT activity to enhance the servitization performance.

Abstract: Abstract
Environmental constraints lead to important changes in the innovation strategies of manufacturing firms. In this paper, the development of Product-Service Systems (PSS) in 10 manufacturing firms that are part of the French CAC40 Index is studied. A special effort is made to investigate the reasons and the forms of PSS development, their impact on innovation management as well as the prerequisites and limits of their implementation. The case study analysis shows the links between eco-innovation strategy and PSS development. The PSS provided by firms remain mainly basic hybrid products with product-oriented services while only a limited number of pure hybrid products with use or result-oriented services are currently being developed. Regarding the innovation management issues, eco-innovation strategy and PSS development increase the need for external skills and thus require open innovation strategies. Finally, the ability to develop PSS appears to be linked to the firms' internal learning and their position within the value chain.

Abstract: Abstract
Servicizing is a business model that holds the potential to support a shift towards more sustainable production and consumption by selling to the consumer the product's function, rather than the material product itself. This can offer direct environmental benefits by reducing the material and energy intensity of market transactions. Servicizing based business offers are starting emerging on the market, but public policy support could accelerate this process. This article is a review of the state of the art in the field and of relevant policy initiatives addressing servicizing conducted for that project. It aims to explore where and how public policy supports or steers markets toward servicizing solutions. The article examines the development of the servicizing concept and identifies where and when policy support for servicizing is merited. It also reviews several existing policy instruments to support servicizing on European, national and local (municipal) levels. Policy initiatives include R&amp;D support, energy efficiency obligation schemes, chemicals, waste and transportation policies. The conclusions focus on the possibilities and limits of public policy support and promotion of servicizing.

Abstract: Abstract
The objects of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) case studies are often individual components or individual products. Studies focusing on larger industrial manufacturing systems are relatively rare. The purpose of this case study was to assess environmental and cost-related performance of an updated complex manufacturing system for glass containers (i.e. jars, glass bottles, etc.) compared to the predecessor manufacturing system. The objective was also to identify the most relevant drivers for the environmental and the cost profile of the system solution in application context by the means of Life Cycle Assessment, as well as Life Cycle Costing (LCC). The results were then to be displayed in an Eco-Care-Matrix (ECM) in order to quantitatively visualize the improvements when comparing the updated manufacturing system to the previous one and they were to be discussed in terms of (i) ecodesign levers, (ii) efficiency of the LCA process and (iii) their relevance for the speed and cost of the decision-making process. The LCA results of the production stage of the optimized components showed that the largest contributors to the potential environmental impact of the manufacturing system are the motors due to their material composition, number and mass. The use stage was subsequently recognized as the dominant life cycle stage with Global Warming Potential (GWP) as the leading indicator, due to the long service life (20 years) and the corresponding energy consumption. The analysis of a produced glass bottle's GWP showed that it was reduced by about 40% through optimizing the production system. The LCC showed that the modernization pays off after about five years of service life and that the decision for making an investment should not only be based on the required capital expenditure (CAPEX). Rather, operation expenditure (OPEX) should also be considered in order to reflect the savings gained from lower operating costs, which compensate relatively quickly any higher initial expenditure or initial investment. In order to apply Life Cycle Assessment on larger-scale industrial systems, smart and pragmatic LCA modeling approaches have to be developed and adopted, balancing accuracy of results against efficiency in achieving them. An adequate ecological-and-economic assessment tool would reduce the time and effort when making decisions in this context.

Abstract: Abstract
The efficient and effective management of changes in manufacturing constitutes a key success factor for industrial enterprises in a highly dynamic world. Despite its undoubted importance, the management of manufacturing changes as a dedicated field of research has rarely been a focus of engineering science. However, other fields of research, such as Engineering Change Management (ECM) or continuous factory planning, investigate similar topics (ECM) in a different domain (Product Development) or possess the same object of observation (manufacturing/factories) focusing on different approaches (factory planning). Based on the broad basis of literature available in these fields, a dedicated process for the management of changes in manufacturing – an MCM process – is designed. Guided by the Design Research Methodology (DRM), a total of 42 processes and related process requirements have been comparatively analyzed for the MCM process design. In addition to further detailed analyses of process stages, the article elaborates on the validation approach and results as well as the derived need for further research in the field of Manufacturing Change Management (MCM).

Abstract: Abstract
Today, development of physical products does not only reflect the notion of tangible objects, but rather those of individualized products with associated services; which bring more value to final customers than the pure physical objects without any accessories and services. Thanks to new achievements in ICT, all product stakeholders (e.g., manufacturers, consumers, service providers) have got the possibility to more intensively interact with each other and thereupon profit from that. This novel approach has led the development features of products to a new era of cyber-physical systems, resulting in higher individualized and user-friendly product experiences, reflecting intelligent and connected products throughout their life-cycles. Accordingly, such products configure product-service systems with accompanying several merits, e.g., flexibility, adaptability, reactivity, expertise, and x-gradability. Prospective products due to their adaptable design, associated services and Avatars are able to cover a range of customizations upon the current and prospective needs of customers. Besides, manufacturers can profit from this approach for adopting new production strategies. This perspective is recommended and conceptually explored in this paper.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-service system (PSS) business models are now more widely used for business to consumer exchanges due to the popularity of the ‘sharing economy’ or ‘collaborative consumption’. While there are claims that PSS offer more sustainable consumption alternatives, there is a shortage of literature regarding PSS business practices and the factors that may influence their environmental performance. In addition, few studies have investigated PSS in emerging economies. In this paper, we examine PSS business practices in relation to environmental sustainability for twenty businesses in Hanoi, Manila and Bangkok. Our aim is to understand business practices in this emerging economy context, and to determine the factors that enable or inhibit PSS businesses from achieving environmentally sustainable outcomes. We identified six sustainability criteria from the literature as the basis for analysing business practices: 1) using durable, quality goods; 2) intensifying use of goods; 3) enabling repair, take back and recycling of goods; 4) ensuring rental replaces purchase; 5) minimising transport and disposable packaging of goods; and for transport – 6) reducing private vehicle kilometres travelled. Through qualitative analysis of interviews we found that business participants generally performed well in criteria 1–2, but performance across the remaining criteria depended on the context such as: market conditions, public infrastructure, housing form, customer behaviour and the nature of the product. Our findings highlight the need for policy interventions to facilitate more sustainable outcomes, including: guidelines and green accreditation; planning regulations/incentives to provide space for PSS businesses; and policies to encourage multiple passengers for transport sharing.

Abstract: Abstract
It is said that PCB (printed circuit board) of used electronics contains considerable amount of critical metals, rare earths, and so on. However, one of the problems in utilizing such used products is that the valuable materials scatter among huge numbers of small-sized electronics. Efficient methods of collection and concentration are necessary. Although manual disassembly and separation of PCB is a good way to enhance the quality of the recycled materials, it causes a large labor cost. As a solution to this problem, this paper focuses on a new concept of recycling process which is to outsource such manual operation to unspecified workers via internet. The concept will be also helpful to reduce environmental impact caused by unnecessary transportation of the used products. This paper has proposed the concept of the outsourcing of recycling operations and discussed the advantages of the concept. And then, it tried to prototype a mechanism to enable the idea. The paper carried out a basic design of screening and sorting mechanisms and made some experiments of operation. The basic results obtained in this paper clarified that the remote recycling concept is feasible and promising.

Abstract: Abstract
This study analyses how drivers of PSS enable supplier companies to adoption integrated solutions in B2B relationships. Two case studies were performed in two large supplier companies that operate in different segments, which represents a significant Brazilian market share. The findings show that this adopted PSS strategies enable the two companies to operate their customer's systems and to price their offerings according to the established performance. The strategies adopted by the companies provide a more rigorous knowledge about the products and services, attention to promoting the buyers’ support over the life cycle and promote the relationships with buyers.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper seeks to explore a distinct form of improvisation as a specific coping mechanism for organizing the integration demands across PSS life cycles. The line of argumentation is based on state-of-the art literature which calls for a new form of organizing in PSS and the recent theoretical discourse of organizational improvisation in organization research. It is argued that organizational improvisation addresses the high integration demands and fosters the capability of innovative ad hoc problem-solving in PSS. An empirical investigation is introduced in order to specify a distinct pattern of organizational improvisation for PSS as a context of highly integrated value creation. The empirical results reveal a specific form of improvisation which can be characterized as a pattern of rapid responses for solving ad hoc problems in a selective bricolage of internal and external knowledge. On this basis an improvisation-integration model is suggested which outlines that organizational improvisation, as specified in this paper, may contribute to the mutual integration of product and service in a customer-specific way.

Abstract: Abstract
The aim of the paper is to present an approach for the multidisciplinary evaluation of alternative modular concepts in preliminary design with the intent of enhancing engineers’ capability to simulate alternative scenarios with different design configurations, so to derive decisions about the most valuable design concepts to further develop. The research contribution is novel in the way that it expands the Set-Based-Engineering approach by addressing the “servitization” challenge in two ways: firstly by the use of value models and sustainability models as decision making support, making possible a preliminary assessment of the value contribution and of the sustainability performances of a design concept; secondly, by the use of functional modelling modules and configurable systems elements for platform-based design, to manage the complex relationships within and between parts of the platform throughout the lifecycle. The paper presents the main features of the approach and introduces an industrial case concerning the development of a module component for an aircraft engine in which the approach is applied for demonstration. The paper finally elaborates on the benefits and implications of the approach in the design process.

Abstract: Abstract
The Business Model (BM) transformation process, changing from a traditional manufacturing BM to BM focused on servitization (servitized BM), may increase the management complexity, which is also reflected in a need of superior levels of organizational knowledge. Therefore, one alternative to deal with this challenge is by acquiring knowledge from suppliers. However, there is still a lack of studies analyzing the collaboration intensity and knowledge transfer with suppliers to be successful in the BM transformation for servitization. Thus, this paper aims to understand how companies deal with suppliers’ knowledge integration aiming for servitization and to understand the knowledge transfer dynamics in this integration. Aiming this, we adapted to the context of servitized solutions development, the framework proposed by Le Dain and Merminod (2014) for supplier integration in collaborative new product development (NPD), which combines three typical supplier involvement configurations (black, grey and white box integration) with the three knowledge sharing levels proposed by Carlile (2004) (transfer, translation and transformation). By means of a multiple-case study analysis of seven multinational companies, we first reinterpreted the three classical supplier integration configuration, showing how they can happen in servitization; then, we analyzed the levels of knowledge sharing that are present in each one of the three suppliers’ involvement configurations. Our results show differences of the framework when compared to the original one for supplier involvement. We also discuss causes of such a difference between purely product development and servitized product development.

Abstract: Abstract
End-of-Life (EoL) strategies, and especially products’ lifespan extension, are becoming key issues for more and more manufacturers. Their implementations have to be done from the design stage and may be facilitated with design methodologies and guidelines. However, if a function of the system is no longer efficient enough during its use phase, in such a way that remanufacturing and upgrading may not be considered, the system has reached its final EoL, even if it might have been used for other applications.

To address such kind of situations, the present paper investigates the concept of Design-2-Life (D2L) systems. To do so, EoL strategies will be explored to understand the key issues. Then a clear explanation of D2L concept will be proposed as well as its main characteristics. Finally we will discuss the challenges of this new approach and the advantages to develop it under a PSS framework. The case of batteries used in electric cars will be used to illustrate the concept.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-service systems (PSSs) have been highlighted as a prevailing trend for manufacturers to survive the modern era of tough competition in their industries. Despite the importance of the customer in such systems, previous studies offer little in terms of evaluating new PSS concepts from the customers’ perspective. To fill this academic lacuna, this paper proposes a method for evaluating such concepts that focuses on their acceptability to customers. The proposed approach is based on customer perceptions of value throughout the customer experience cycle: customers’ acceptability results from their comparison of new PSS concepts with existing products. This approach successfully employs the analytic network process and niche theory to quantify customers’ perceptions of their experience of PSSs. A short case study shows the usefulness of the proposed approach, which is expected to aid manufacturers adopting PSS strategies.

Abstract: Abstract
There is a need for metrics to analyse complex business models in the circular economy. Life cycle assessment (LCA) currently is the best defined system to analyse the environmental aspects, and is capable to analyse circular systems, Product Service Systems, and systems for recycling. However LCA falls short of analysis of the added value of business models. Since new sustainable business models are part of the transition towards a circular economy, there is a need for combined analyses of value and eco-burden.

This paper applies the LCA-based Eco-costs Value Ratio (EVR) Model to analyse potential negative environmental effects of business initiatives on a system level, and to provide a theoretical approach to the design of sustainable business models by means of a three dimensional approach of costs, eco-costs and market value. Two methods are applied for analysis and design: Eco-efficient Value Creation (EVR benchmarking) and the Circular Transition Framework (describing stakeholder activities which are required for the transition towards sustainable business models).

The practical case of the analysis, design and implementation of a business model for sustainable water recreation in Friesland (a province in the Netherlands) is used to validate the usefulness of these two LCA-based methods.

The conclusion is that the approach of Eco-efficient Value Creation helps to avoid many pitfalls of the design of circular business models (e.g. having a positive result on product level, but having a negative effect on societal level; having a positive effect on the environment but having insufficient customer perceived value to overcome fierce market competition). The Circular Transition Framework reveals pitfalls and opportunities in implementation (e.g. the coordination between business models and governmental policies).

Abstract: This article describes how an IPS2 network should be build up by considering the dynamic behavior of the IPS2 along its lifecycle. How the network partner could participate and how they allocate their capacities will be also discussed as questions regarding the commissioning while considering the business model.

The realization of this concept is based on a multi-agent system. Therefore all objects involved in the IPS2 operation phase like tangible product shares, network partners and service technicians are represented by software agents.

All this will be pointed out by an availability oriented maintenance scenario in the field of micro production.

Abstract: Abstract
Service growth in product firms is one of the most active service research domains and is open to a variety of conceptualizations. This article provides a critical inquiry into the past, present, and future of the research domain. The evolution of the research on service growth is discussed in two phases: (1) setting the boundaries of the research domain, and (2) emergence of the conceptual foundation. We find that while research in this area has a well-established tradition in terms of output, theoretically it is still largely in a ‘nascent’ phase. Next, we highlight the contributions of the papers in this special section, emphasizing their challenges to prevailing assumptions in the research domain. We conclude by identifying, from the contributions to this special section, suggested themes for further research on service growth: the assessment of empirical evidence of the impact of service growth on firm performance, the role of merger &amp; acquisitions in the service growth strategy, the exploration of single/multiple positions along the transition line, the process of adding or removing services, and expanding the context of service growth beyond product manufacturing firms.

Abstract: Abstract
In competitive and time sensitive market places, organisations are tasked with providing product lifecycle management (PLM) approaches to achieve and maintain competitive advantage, react to change and understand the balance of possible options when making decisions on complex multi-faceted problems, global production networks (GPN) is one such domain in which this applies. When designing and configuring GPN to develop, manufacture and deliver product–service provision, information requirements that affect decision making become more complex. The application of reference ontologies to a domain and its related information requirements can enhance and accelerate the development of new product-service systems with a view towards the seamless interchange of information or interoperability between systems and domains.

This paper presents (i) preliminary results for the capture and modelling of end-user information, (ii) an initial higher level reference core ontology for the development of reference ontologies and (iii) the formal logical modelling of Level 1 of the FLEXINET reference ontology using a Common Logic based approach.

Abstract: Current Product Service Systems (PSS) research mainly focuses on car sharing schemes and chemical management services, which has not really addressed consumer products. Existing methods and tools related to PSS are mainly concerned with general PSS and service design, which can not readily assist manufacturers of consumer products to implement and realize PSS solutions. This paper proposes a methodology for the realization of product-oriented and use-oriented PSS for consumer products through the use of product lifecycle data. It has been demonstrated in large-scale field trials that product related services can be delivered through the PSS built utilizing the methodology proposed. The PSS methodology proposed within this research study can contribute to next generation product design, which will be intelligent, sustainable and environmentally sensitive.

Abstract: The servicisation of many advanced economies is thought by many commentators to provide opportunities to move society away from unsustainable patterns of production and consumption. The concept of the Product Service System (PSS) has been conceptualised in academic circles to assist in the attainment of such desirable futures. This paper reports the findings of research conducted as part of the SOLiD project which considered the transfer and application of the PSS concept from academia to industry in the United Kingdom. It draws upon theories from evolutionary economics to provide a rationale for the transfer of the PSS concept and the role of this in achieving desirable technological change. The paper also identifies an appropriate methodology to transfer the PSS concept from UK academic circles to industry and the factors which impact upon, and importantly lead to, the successful completion of this process. The combination of theoretical insight with case study research is used to develop a framework that could help UK based intermediaries to complete the transfer of the PSS concept. This is seen as an integral part of public policies aimed at stimulating sustainable patterns of production and consumption.

Abstract: Abstract
Co-creating value is central to providing product–service solutions. The present study contributes to a better understanding of the transition process from traditional transaction-oriented roles to future co-creation roles within provider–customer relationships. Our inductive analysis of cross-comparative case studies, including eight provider–customer relationships, identifies significant role ambiguities among actors involved in this transition. In addition to identifying challenges, we explain how relational coping strategies help the partners manage the presence of role ambiguities during the value co-creation process. Notably, three types of role ambiguities (vague role expectations, unclear role descriptions and uncertain role scripts) often serve as barriers to co-creating value across different phases of the value co-creation process and require different relational response strategies (role clarification, role redefinition and role adaption) to cope with unclear expectations, responsibilities and demands. The present study contributes to the emerging literature on value co-creation by underlining the role dynamics in provider and customer relationships during the co-creation process of product–service solutions.

Abstract: Abstract
Todays efforts to optimize industrial production processes exceedingly focus on tools’ life cycle costs. Toolmaker and its customer are the two entities influencing tools’ life cycle costs. Due to lack of information exchange neither life cycle assessment nor cost efficient life cycles can be realized. An effective lever for penetrating information exchange and therefore gaining cost efficiency alongside tool's life cycle is the integration of the toolmaker into the value creation process of its customer. The so called customer integration succeeds through innovative product-service systems alongside tools’ life cycle networking the value creation processes of toolmaker and tool user. As the findings of research project TEC in this paper practical solutions for realizing customer integration are introduced and measures for gaining life cycle cost efficiency alongside tool's life cycle are explained.

Abstract: Despite the noteworthy changes towards product-service system (PSS) as a sustainable solution, a systematic methodology to measure sustainability is surprisingly sparse. Previous literature in measuring sustainability still remains no more than static and fragmentary, which cannot fully incorporate the characteristics of PSS: a ‘dynamic’ system which includes various actors and a large, complex system with ‘multidimensional’ impacts. To support the dynamic and multidimensional characteristics of PSS, we employ system dynamics (SD) to cover the dynamics, and triple bottom line (TBL) to encompass the multidimensionality of PSS sustainability, respectively. To illustrate the working of proposed approach, the case study of a public bicycle system is presented. The proposed approach is expected to effectively measure PSS sustainability through a comprehensive view.

Abstract: Trajectories of service innovations emanating from manufacturing sectors have been of particular interest to those wishing to improve resource productivity and promote sustainable development. Research has focused on product service systems (PSSs), which are a category of service innovations deliberately designed to offer superior environmental performance. This paper draws on research which explored whether trajectories of PSS can be induced on new UK housing developments to satisfy household demand and prevent household waste. The research was undertaken with a UK speculative house-builder and facilities management service providers from its supplier network. Qualitative data were collected via interviews and focus groups to enable rich accounts of the range of factors in these firms' selection environments which affect receptivity to PSS production to be developed. These were compared with factors affecting receptivity to PSS production identified in a study of UK manufacturers. The results show that in contrast to the manufacturing study, clear drivers for PSS delivery on new housing developments are absent in external selection environments of participating firms and uncertainty associated with the potential of PSS concepts to satisfy household demand inhibits development of requisite competence for PSS delivery within these. Thus further research is needed to explore new PSS supply arrangements involving a range of household service providers.

Abstract: Abstract
Servitization requires that manufacturers shift their organizational capabilities and processes from sales to product-service systems and recognize the broader business activities of customer service companies. This study models the knowledge-based transition to the provider–customer relationship, using an actor network model for an auto-parts manufacturer as an example. We propose a model chain that explains the servitization process for construction equipment. A technical tool for design-in-use activities of customers is crucial to transform servitization into the next phase. Interconnections among activity cycles of providers and customers result in the transformation of the functional structure through service provision and knowledge transfer.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper discusses maintenance strategies for large technical systems with long life-cycles and critical availability needs. The use of sea freight is rapidly increasing, and thereby the use of container harbors as well. The case of Gothenburg harbor in Sweden is used to discuss appropriate construction and maintenance strategies focusing on availability. Investment costs, operational costs and societal costs are discussed along with environmental impact considerations. Different aspects and considerations affecting costs are also discussed, such as pay-back time and external uncertainties. The paper is based on an extensive literature review as well as interviews with harbor personnel.

Abstract: Abstract
This study develops a profiling framework that allows systematic comparison of different value constellations of industrial, service-based business models. Following the systematic review method, 154 research articles on servitization are analyzed using this profiling approach, producing an integrative meta-model of servitization. Three different approaches to represent servitization in studies are identified: 1) end-state models; 2) gradual transition models, and 3) stepwise progression models. These are systematically compared and eight conceptually different, generic value constellations ranging from low to high levels of servitization are identified: products with limited support; installed and supported products; complementary services; product-oriented solutions; systems leasing; operating services; managed service solutions; and total solutions. These form a pattern of servitization showing increases in complexity of the offering and value for the customer as well as changes in operational responsibilities in the value constellations. This approach resolves the gap of conceptual incommensurability’ in the literature by providing a reference against which the different value constellations of servitization can be compared. The meta-model connects the various perspectives, models and terminology into a base line theory of servitization as a process, and enables a systematic comparison of the different empirical studies.

Abstract: Abstract
The main objective of the paper is to highlight the important aspects of the data management in condition monitoring and maintenance, especially when the emergent technologies, such as the cloud computing and big data, are to be considered in the maintenance department. In addition, one of the main data management elements highlighted in the current work are the cybersecurity issues which might be one of the biggest obstacles hindering the development of cloud based big data for condition-based maintenance (CBM) purposes. Further, the benefits and current risks of storing a company's data in the cloud are highlighted. The authors discuss as well different data needs in various processes in the area of asset management. In addition, the challenges and issues to be addressed for the optimal use of the company data at the cloud together with the big data approach are addressed. This is seen as an important part in an effort to achieve sustainable information and communication technologies for the industry.

Abstract: Abstract
Co-creating integrated solutions with customers requires collaboration of different partners within a value network. In this emerging context, knowledge is considered as a foundation for value co-creation. Therefore, identifying different types of issues, with which value network actors in knowledge transfer are confronted, is conceived as a first step toward, on the one hand, the prevention of the failure of knowledge exchange initiatives in a network, and on the other hand, the enhancement of the collaborative process of knowledge sharing. This requires shifting the conventional approach on knowledge transfer issues from an intra-organizational to an inter-organizational network. This paper aims to systematically identify and classify knowledge transfer issues with both tacit and explicit knowledge considerations. In doing so, we have first conducted a systematic literature review to identify issues. Secondly, these issues have been classified into six main categories and 29 subcategories through a structured classification approach. The proposed classification framework provides a comprehensive and wide spectrum of possible issues related to knowledge transfer within a value network. It also presents a step towards an improved awareness of such issues in order to resolve problems in transferring knowledge in such contexts.

Abstract: Abstract
The defence context more recently has been experiencing a significant shift towards servitization. As competition has increased, commercial strategies are increasingly moving towards providing through-life solutions for complex engineering products such as submarines. Within such a context value for money is an essential driver in a life cycle sense for selecting a bid. The defence sector has largely been affected by this change in the business environment. Industrial Product Service System (IPS2) is a model of providing services that satisfy industrial customers and aims to reduce lifecycle impacts of products and services through product servicing, remanufacturing and recycling. This approach has proved to be an effective solution to enhance the services support in military projects. IPS2 offers client value by responding more efficiently to the client demands with reduced prices; it is delivered in the form of contracting approaches between Ministry of Defence (MoD) and industry; these contracts can differ in several aspects as risk sharing, application level, ownership policy and supportability specifications vary. This research focuses on Contracting for Availability (CfA), which is a particular approach of IPS2.The paper aims to present the review of literature in designing support strategies for CfA, identifying the good practices and challenges, and to propose a systematic approach to fill the industrial and academic gap towards an optimization of the current modelling process. This work starts by presenting a literature review in IPS2; it then moves into the optimization processes, describing how contractors currently design a long term service support contract in the military context with better value for money and high level of system readiness. The key cost and performance drivers are identified and a framework is presented to enhance the design process of CfA. The methodology of the paper relies on literature. This research aims to extend the work of several authors in predicting the cost of services in the military contracts.

Abstract: With increasing use of weather observation and forecast services, there is an urgent need of an effective and efficient system to generate high-quality weather services and products. For example, weather maps are expected to be submitted not only for decision-making departments but also to websites whose main feature is to provide public service products on a daily or an hourly basis. In this study, first, geoprocessing is successfully extended to handle the entire process of weather map generation from data, and some associated key issues are discussed. Second, based on the distributed computing technology, an application system with multitiered architecture for weather services products generation system is designed and implemented. The system significantly enhances sharing and scalability. Finally, an application case is studied in detail by illustrating modeling, task deployment, and final execution, and it is shown that the operational system meets the requirements of simplicity, easy modeling, and customizable task deployment.

Abstract: This paper aims to contribute to the discussion about the delivery of integrated solutions in the capital goods industry. The paper is based on an in-depth case study and presents a solution delivery framework that can help companies in the professional printing industry devise, deliver and price integrated solutions. The case of Océ suggests that succeeding as a solution provider requires developing the capability to provide highly customised service logic-based solutions while retaining the capability to provide, efficiently, standardised goods logic-based solutions. Hence, it suggests that adopting different delivery approaches to address customers with different types of needs can help achieve such a capability.

Abstract: This article proposes a new method for evaluating Product/Service System (PSS). It improves formulation of an evaluation step within an existing comprehensive method for designing PSS. The evaluation is achieved based on the importance of various customer value and each offering's contribution to the value as well as the customer's budget. Its advantage is the effective utilization of design information accumulated at the earlier part of the comprehensive method, as opposed to marketing oriented methods solely for utility measurement (e.g. conjoint analysis). Application of the entire method to a real life case at an investment machine manufacturer is presented.

Abstract: In the last decade many researchers, institutes and programs in the EU paid attention to product-service systems (PSS). Given this massive effort, it is time to take stock. Is PSS research a theoretical field in its own right? Is the PSS concept indeed the road to the Factor 10 world? Is it the road to enhanced competitiveness? What is needed to really use the potential of the concept? This paper discusses these questions summarizing the analysis done in the PSS review book ‘New Business for Old Europe’, various EU sponsored projects and the conceptual approach chosen in a new research network on Sustainable Consumption and Production, called SCORE!

Abstract: Abstract
Customers’ individual preferences are calling for more variety of the firms offerings. Faced with this situation, firms endeavor to meet customer requirements while reducing their costs and impact on environment in order to remain competitive. Further on, achieving such a goal entails various issues that need to be tackled such as the multiple performance drivers and criteria relating to sustainability and variety. Accordingly, tradeoffs need to be defined and balanced between such heterogeneous criteria in order to facilitate the decision making process on variety levels with regards to sustainability impact. These tradeoffs should involve decision makers so as to reflect firm priorities and takes into account its realm. This paper proposes an approach supporting the decision making process on variety delivered to the market while taking into account sustainability criteria. More specifically, the approach uses performance indicators which are calculated by LCA based tools, then applies weightings, and finally computes the expected variety levels for a given demand data. The paper highlights the impact of variety steering on environmental and economic sustainability indicators.

Abstract: Abstract
Availability-based contracts which provide customers with the use of assets such as machines, ships, aircraft platforms or subsystems like engines and avionics are increasingly offered as an alternative to the purchase of an asset and separate support contracts. The cost of servicing a durable product can be addressed by Through-life Costing (TLC). Providers of advanced services are now concerned with the cost of delivering outcomes that meet customer requirements using combinations of assets and activities via a Product Service System (PSS). This paper addresses the question: To what extent are the current approaches to TLC methodologically appropriate for costing the provision of advanced services, particularly availability, through a PSS? A novel methodology for TLC is outlined addressing the challenges of PSS cost assessment with regard to ‘what?’ (cost object), ‘why/to what extent?’ (scope and boundaries), and ‘how?’ (computations). The research provides clarity for those seeking to cost availability in a performance-orientated contractual setting and provides insight to the measures that may be associated with it. In particular, a reductionist approach that focuses on one cost object at a time is not appropriate for a PSS. Costing an advanced service delivered through a PSS is a problem of attributing the value of means to the economic activities carried out for specific ends to be achieved. Cost results from the interplay between monetary and non-monetary metrics, and uncertainties thereof. Whilst seeking to ensure generality of the findings, the application of TLC examined here is limited to a military aircraft platform and subsystems.

Abstract: The concept of Product–Service System (PSS) prevails as a systemic approach for enabling a strategic and managerial transition from selling physical goods to providing product–service solutions that fulfil customer-specific and changeable needs. Besides the potential strategic and economic relevance, many companies do not know how to provide a PSS in an effective way and often incur in high costs without any expected return.

In this context, it is becoming relevant to engineer PSS solutions envisioning and encompassing their whole lifecycle. For this purpose, it is necessary to rely on a well-framed PSS engineering process. The contribution of this paper is mainly addressed to understand which are the main characteristics (how) and the structure and sequence of the phases (what order) characterising a PSS engineering process model. The paper reports two case studies which provide the baseline for the identification of good practices and of a reference process model for PSS engineering.

Abstract: Abstract
The increasing number and economic importance of production networks is one sign of the on-going paradigm shift from industrial production to value co-creation. This transformation can be described by using the notions of a value creation taxonomy, which is introduced in this paper and gives a structured overview of relevant aspects of the underlying conversion from top down to bottom up economics. In order to gain a deeper understanding of this transformation process, the specific design, characteristics and challenges of those networks will be investigated with regard to their time-dependence using a life cycle model.

The present study contributes to a fundamental understanding of the importance of openness as a key success factor of value co-creation in production networks. It gives a systematic characterization of what is meant by “openness” concerning the value creation system, the value creation process and the value creation artifact. Furthermore, an adjusted life cycle model is presented, which may support both, assessment and configuration of openness within those networks by deriving adequate and phase-specific measures.

Abstract: Abstract
The study analyses how purchasing companies perceive value added in the products and services purchased from their suppliers. Secondarily, it identifies the determining criteria for the decision to purchase and the development of lasting relationships. As a method of research, multiple case studies were used in 12 companies in three distinct industries with production units in southern Brazil. The results of the survey revealed that the elements that add value are perceived differently depending on the industry and may be related to the type of business and the strategies adopted by companies. The metal-mechanics industry is more demanding regarding the criteria for adding value and relationship. The food and furniture industries prioritize the creation and the delivery of value.

Abstract: Many environmental and social problems emerged from our modern production and consumption habits are comparable with the symptoms of physical obesity. Based on this metaphor, effective approaches in obesity treatment can serve as a good reference in order to respond to over-consumption problems. Instead of stressing consumers to change their behaviours, we can attract them by means of providing appropriately designed PSS offers and giving them the opportunities to become aware of better alternatives. Successful examples seem to document support for the hypothesis that, ‘the multidimensional and dynamic approaches are the most promising diet solutions, which can lead to a leaner production and consumption figure.’

Abstract: Abstract
Service Engineering (SE) discipline is currently supporting companies during the engineering and re-engineering phases of their service offering. With the support of SE methods, companies can undertake their servitization journey with the best premise to gain as well as deliver value to their customers. For this purpose, the Service Engineering Methodology (SEEM) has been proposed. The SEEM entails methods to design service concepts and processes capable of balancing value between customers and the company. Some industrial cases, carried out in collaboration with ABB, a leading provider in power and automation technology, demonstrate the effectiveness of such methodology in the re-engineering of existing services in B2B context. Despite that, the cases show that the SEEM application is time consuming, especially in the validation of the service provision process. Thus, in order to facilitate and speed up the implementation of the methodology, a standard process for service provision becomes relevant. Then, starting from the re-engineering of the existing product-oriented services offered by ABB, this paper aims at laying the foundation for the definition of a reference model and a standard process model for product-oriented service delivery. The results will support the SEEM adoption and the definition of service processes avoiding the design of customized models, that cannot be compared and adapted to different realities. In line with what has been found in literature, the definition of a possible reference model and a preliminary standard process model are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
As service sectors in manufacturing companies become more and more important, Performance Indicators (PIs) will need to be taken into further consideration in order to assess the efficiency and effectiveness of service performances. Hence, PIs are designed to help the organizations and decision makers to better understand how well they are performing in relation to their strategic, tactical and operational goals. While keeping in mind that services are contributing more and more to rise an enterprise turnover, measuring and controlling their performances plays an important role in turning company strategic objectives and goals to reality. It is essential for a company to determine the most significant indicators, how they are related to the formulated company goals and how they depend on performed activities. In this respect, the purpose of this paper is to lay out a method for generating and selecting the PIs related to particular service system requirements.

This paper defines an overall PI Toolset which has been developed specifically for Virtual Manufacturing Enterprise (VME) but could also be used for a single enterprise and for a wider set of enterprises in cooperation with additional bodies (e.g. Labs, Industrial associations, universities, etc…). Especially, PI Toolset could be adopted by VMEs in order to improve the management of the service system they want to create through the specification and classification of precised use case objectives. After analyzing the state of the art in literature, a new approach has been developed which provides both a governance methodology and a list of relevant PIs for services. Actually, the proposed PI Toolset may help enterprises in selecting the activity to be monitored, controlled and measured through appropriate PIs. The proposed method essentially consists of a guideline to design, implement and classify effective PIs related to an enterprise's goals and objectives.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper proposes an approach based on mathematical modeling for tactical and operational decision-making in urban distribution of goods. Collaborative and non-collaborative scenarios are compared using real-data from the city of Bogota, Colombia. Both scenarios are modeled as capacitated vehicle routing problems (CVRP). Results highlight the quantitative benefits that can be achieved when collaborative logistics operations are implemented, represented in transportation costs reduction and service level increase when final demand is uncertain. Although these results might not be surprising, the contribution of this paper is centered in the fact that the impacts of collaboration in urban logistics have not yet been quantified and well understood. This work opens new directions for further research in this field.

Abstract: Current design of improved product generations does not exploit use information from previous products systematically. The emerging shift of manufacturing companies from selling products to providing product service systems, the miniaturization of product-embedded sensors, as well as advances in information technology facilitate a product providers access to operation information of current products, which can be used to improve the development and the quality of follower product generations. The paper presents a framework for the acquisition, aggregation and analysis of product use information as well as for the generation and provision of knowledge for the development of improved product generations. The described approach employs knowledge discovery methods like Bayesian Networks and is supported by an IT prototype of a design assistant system. This prototype has been validated in a use case considering the improvement of a rotary spindle for micro machining.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite significant advantages from manufacturer, consumer and societal perspectives, the share of remanufactured products is still low in most industries. Commitment of original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) is limited due to the manifold barriers and challenges that were hitherto unknown in the traditional production environment. Based on the Business Model Canvas, a methodology identifying feasible options for competitive remanufacturing by evaluating case-specific barriers and challenges in order to cope with the corresponding complexity has been developed. Product-service systems are systematically utilized to exploit the potentials of remanufacturing. The methodology is demonstrated for OEM-oriented remanufacturing in medical technology, specifically an insulin pump.

Abstract: Abstract
Maintenance serves as the major engineering service in the PSS delivery model, it has a key role in delivering performance driven solutions. Leveraging the strengths of a dynamic PSS network for maintenance performance has become essential to satisfy rapidly changing customer demands and to remain competitive. Firms are therefore aiming to further their maintenance competence, which we define as the ability of the PSS networks to improve products and services, based on the processes and relationships established with PSS partners and customers. The purpose of this research is therefore to provide insight into how intangible capital among PSS network partners can be effectively utilized for maintenance performance. This study examines how intangible capital and knowledge further the development of maintenance competence within the context of a PSS network. A theoretical model is verifiedthroughstructural equation modeling utilizing survey data collected from a PSS network, which consists ofa large agricultural machine manufacturer, three providers for intelligent terminal instruments and 1000 small- and medium-sized service stations and distributors in the manufacturing industry. The results indicated that human capital and organizational capital are positively related to knowledge type development, which in turn has a positive effect on maintenance performance in PSS networks. This study contributes to the theoretical development of a conceptual model by examining the mediating role of explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge in the relation human capital and organizational capital with maintenance performance. Conclusively, an outlook for further research is given.

Abstract: Abstract
A fundamental demand for IT service providers is to obtain design skills for non-functional requirements (NFRs) of a target IT enabled service system. The design task should identify a number of NFR determinants, such as the architecture of the IT infrastructure, the operational procedure, and the human resources for service delivery. The satisfaction of NFRs has not been validated after implementation or deployment of the service, which causes extensive redesign work. Thus, a modeling method to bridge NFR and IT service design for reducing such risks is introduced, and an NFR evaluation model is provided. Consequently, IT service designers can validate NFRs in the early development phase.

Abstract: Due to customers’ constantly increasing demand for personalized products and services, manufacturing enterprises must provide more diverse physical products and services in the product sale stage. However, the massive diversity of personalized products and services offered leads to the internal diversification of products and services, which greatly increases production costs. The application of the modular method can effectively improve the reusability of a product or service, and reduce internal diversification of the product and service. In this paper, the interactive modular design process is established by the analysis of the relationship between a product or service of integrated service product (ISP) and the analysis of the physical module and service module. This paper deals with the module partition principle of ISP, puts forward the three-stages module partition processes and methods, mainly including service module partition processes based on the “Top-Down” and “Bottom-Up” methods, the physical module partition process based on the “Top-Down”, and the module partition methods based on Quality Function Deployment and mapping matrix. Finally, a case study is done on an electric power transformer using proposed principle and methods, and the processes and methods can achieve the interactive module partition of ISP.

Abstract: Manufacturing enterprises around the world have made significant efforts to provide high value added services in addition to their traditional product development and manufacturing business. A product service system (PSS) is presented in this paper which aims to better integrate product development with maintenance and service operations. This project focuses on the maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO) services in the aerospace industry. A MRO service model is proposed for the development of the proposed PSS. An ontology-based knowledge representation model is developed for the reuse of knowledge unambiguously in MRO services. An initial attempt has been made to demonstrate the role of PSS in the aerospace industry as a decision support tool for MRO services. Product lifecycle management (PLM) environment and Web-based technologies have been developed to enable the methodology to provide services and support in the aerospace manufacturing and flight operations business.

Abstract: Companies from industrialized nations have faced with the threat of competition from low-cost countries. We suggest Industrial Product Service Systems (IPS2) as a possible answer. Our article has two main aims. We establish a framework for designing an initial IPS2 which meets current customer and market requirements. Building on this, we broaden our focus to include requirements induced by subsequent changes. We propose a combination of the Net Present Value Approach and the Real Options Approach as a means of determining the quantified value of an IPS2 for an individual customer over its life cycle.

Abstract: Abstract
Optimising performance of complex engineering artefacts, which are typically designed to have a useful life of several decades, becomes very difficult during in-service if lessons learnt are not used properly. The authors argue that performance of long-lived complex artefacts can be improved if adequate product in-service data is fed back to the early stages of the product life cycle. This paper discusses an inclusive life cycle approach to optimising product performance by using knowledge and experience gained during in-service. The problem is presented alongside a review of literature of relevant subject areas. A framework for in-service knowledge management is then presented and operationalised through an industrial case study. The framework is developed from the point of view of an integrated product and service provider. The findings from the case study demonstrate how in-service knowledge can be captured, fed back and reused for the design and manufacture stages of the product lifecycle. This enables designers to learn from in-service product performance by informing subsequent designs with in-service knowledge, and consequently improving the through-life product performance.

Abstract: Product/service-systems (PSS) are in effect an approach to designing integrated products and services with a focus on both customer and product life cycle activities. A range of service-oriented design strategies can be found in current literature, from product-oriented DfX approaches to more customer-oriented approaches, such as integrated solutions. In this article, design strategies related to different types of services are mapped. Case studies from two industrial companies are used to confront the existing literature in order to improve the understanding of how manufacturing companies may align their product and service development activities with their business strategies.

Abstract: Abstract
Driven by both policy pressures and environmental concerns, new business models are becoming applied in waste management mainly based on introducing more equitable and sustainable pricing schemes (e.g. “pay-as-you-throw”): the aim is to support the transition from a tax based system to a pure service based approach, where the user pays for the actual use of the waste management service provided. This new trend requires the service provider's activities to be planned with a schedule that reflects the actual users’ needs in order to reach a real efficiency in the collection phase: dynamic routing and scheduling schemes, which could be enabled through the application of smart technologies, can lead to a more rational use of the resources. In the last decade, technological progresses allowed a growing use of IoT (Internet-of-Things) applications in the service sector; recent pilot applications are being tested also in waste management; one example is the introduction of bin level detection and data transmission technologies for waste collection. This work aims to contribute to the assessment of IoT-based PSS solutions for waste collection. The main objective is to evaluate the cost efficiency of a PSS for waste collection enabling dynamic scheduling, comparing it to the performance of more common schemes (e.g. fixed routing and scheduling service and call-based service). Hybrid simulation modelling – based on system dynamics, discrete events and agent based modelling- has been applied to test the transition from a fixed to a “pay-as-you-throw” fee in WEEE (waste from electrical and electronic equipment). A test case regarding an Italian municipality has been proposed to assess quantitative results based on a simulation model.

Abstract: This article investigates the actual and potential contribution that product service systems (PSSs) can make in moving beyond incremental technological improvements towards a focus on behavioural changes and system innovation in the automobile industry. It begins by discussing the means by which existing and planned PSS initiatives can be evaluated in terms of their contribution towards innovation at the system level in the automotive industry. Building on and expanding earlier work, it is suggested that they should be assessed against an expanded set of five key evaluative criteria including: evidence of ‘higher-order’ learning amongst stakeholders; changes in infrastructure and institutional practice; changes in vehicle design, manufacture and end-of-life management; changes in vehicle ownership structure; and changes in modes of producer–user interactions. Following this discussion, the article provides a structured overview of some current and planned PSS initiatives at the empirical level in the automotive industry. The identified initiatives are then assessed against the key evaluative criteria in an effort to reveal their actual or potential contribution to meeting the sustainability challenges of the automotive industry. Based on this exercise, it is argued that since most current initiatives do not unify these key elements of a PSS in a single coherent system they do not constitute ‘complete’ versions of PSS, and therefore, fail to deliver the full range of envisaged benefits in contributing towards system innovation. The article concludes by outlining some key areas for future research into potential strategies to address such challenges.

Abstract: Abstract
Organisations have been approaching servitisation in an unstructured fashion. This is partially because there is insufficient understanding of the different types of Product-Service offerings. Therefore, a more detailed understanding of Product-Service types might advance the collective knowledge and assist organisations that are considering a servitisation strategy. Current models discuss specific aspects on the basis of few (or sometimes single) dimensions. In this paper, we develop a comprehensive model for classifying traditional and green Product-Service offerings, thus combining business and green offerings in a single model. We describe the model building process and its practical application in a case study. The model reveals the various traditional and green options available to companies and identifies how to compete between services; it allows servitisation positions to be identified such that a company may track its journey over time. Finally it fosters the introduction of innovative Product-Service Systems as promising business models to address environmental and social challenges.

Abstract: Abstract
Original Equipment Manufacturers have recognized that offering After Sales Services enables high revenues. Above this, the offer of After Sales Services combined with primary products is an appropriate instrument to improve customer satisfaction and loyalty. But due to the noticeable increasing competitive pressure in the After Sales Service, a possible solution is the implementation of Lean principles to optimize the customer service-processes. These processes all pursue the target to satisfy the customer's needs. But due to the variety of these processes and difficult, changeable conditions in customer service (varying workload, required material and tools, changing working environment …), there is no valid framework concerning the general conditions and objectives of customer service-processes or no holistic approach for process structuration in these processes. But the framework identification of general conditions as well as a holistic process structuration in customer service is the necessary basis for the implementation of Lean principles. Within this paper (based on a research project funded by the German Research Foundation), the development of a methodical approach to identify general conditions, customer service-objectives and to create a holistic process structuration will be described, which should help the OEMs offering customer services to identify and structure these processes. By the use of this methodical approach, OEMs will be enabled to create a structured process landscape. In the future, this process landscape provides an initial point to implement Lean principles, such as Continuous Improvement or Waste Reduction, in customer service.

Abstract: This paper proposes a new type of service CAD system utilized in Service/Product Engineering (SPE), a much-needed and novel engineering discipline within the background of servicification. In this research a design-object model was defined, and a prototype named Service Explorer was implemented. The model represents critical concepts such as value, costs, functions either of products or of service activities, and entities. Through its application to business cases such as selling washing machines, providing pay-per-wash service, and cleaning washing machines, the Service Explorer was proven to support designers as they describe and operate design objects. In the future we expect that the Service Explorer can help designers with generating new ideas.

Abstract: Abstract
Food sector became industrialized like every other sector during industrial revolution. But this system is not suitable for increasing demand of food. Moreover, half of the world is suffering from hunger while great amount of food products become useless and garbage. It's obvious that this system is highly unsustainable.

From the user's perspective, non-sustainability related problems about choosing what to cook, not knowing how to cook and having less time to prepare healthy food in daily life are focused in this project. Problems of users can be solved with design projects which has also environmentally positive results. The main question of this project is, how design can develop new ways of buying food which will solve this problem and has less environmental impact. The scope of the research is grocery stores, street markets and vegetable/fruit delivery services -in other words- services that makes raw food materials available to consumers.

“Healthy on the Go” project which is the focus of this paper is based on the idea that users buy a package of a defined meal, instead of buying ingredients separately. This article aims to make a usability research of this potential food service project proposal; using questionnaire, interview and persona creating techniques as an approach to the research. Desired results of the research are to understand user behavior and motivations on food material choice; and to reach a conclusion, if such a system would have a positive impact on consumers.

Abstract: Abstract
The past decade has seen exponential yearly growth in installed capacity wind energy power generation. As a result, wind farm (WF) projects have evolved from small scale isolated installations into complex utility scale power generation systems comprising of arrays of large wind turbines (WTs), which are designed to operate in harsh environments. However, this has increased the need for through-life engineering service (TES) for WTs especially in offshore applications, where the operations and maintenance (O&amp;M) becomes more complicated as a result of the harsh marine weather and environmental conditions. In this paper, a generic methodology to benchmark TES in industries is presented and used to assess TES in the wind industry. This was done by identifying the current state-of-the-art in methods and applications, requirements and needs, challenges, and opportunities of TES in the wind sector. Furthermore an illustrative case study on WT gearbox through-life support is presented demonstrating how some of the core aspects, such as remote condition monitoring, can be used to aid the in-service support of wind turbine gearboxes.

Abstract: Abstract
This article aims to develop and test a new approach for comparing sustainability effects (mainly approximated through CO2 emissions) and the total cost of ownership of various business models (Regular Purchasing, Car Pooling, Car Leasing, and Taxiing) applied to private cars with different energy carriers (Biogas, Ethanol, Gasoline, Plug-in Hybrid, and Electric). The results indicate that, out of all of the vehicles, electric vehicles are the most competitive—from both an ecological and economic perspective. Moreover, of all of the business models, Car Pooling is the most competitive when driving short to medium distances, reducing CO2 emissions by 20–40% compared with Regular Purchasing. Meanwhile, Car Leasing emits the same amount of CO2 emissions as Regular Purchasing if both are driven the same number of kilometers per year. The results also indicate that, from a cost effectiveness perspective, people who travel less than 2000 km per year should primarily consider using Taxis or similar services, while Car Pooling is most cost effective for those who travel from 2000 to 8500 km. For those who travel between 8500 and 13,500 km per year, Car Leasing is the most cost effective, and Regular Purchasing is the best option above 13,500 km per year. If most car owners were to accept and adapt to this identified need for a market move towards Car Pooling with Electric Vehicles, necessary transportation could be ensured while significantly reducing the number of cars on the road, whether from Regular Purchasing or Car Leasing, as well as those that run on fossil fuel. This, in turn, would result in less fossil fuel use, fewer emissions, and decreased negative effects on human health.

Abstract: Abstract
Optimizing complex hardware and services into service solutions may significantly reduce the total product life-cycle cost for a customer. Research regarding the customers’ perspective is still scarce, however. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to explore value perceptions among buyers of industrial service solutions developed for complex product platforms. The study is based on the experiences of one commercial and three governmental customers procuring service solutions for aviation products. As could be expected, direct financial benefits in the form of cost reduction were an important motive for the studied organizations. In reality, however, it turned out to be difficult to verify if these goals had been fulfilled. This may be seen both as an indicator of the complexity of the business, and the lack of clear baseline data, when the new service provider entered the field. Still, the customers were satisfied with the partnership, with several of them eager to learn from the provider, even if the learning process was painful.During the procurement process itself the quality and richness of the relationship with the new partner was important for signaling capability. End-users, however, seemed to be under-used and not sufficiently involved in the relationship during this process. The results also show that continuous proposals for improvements from the service provider are highly valued among customers.

Abstract: AbstractDesign
of more sustainable products is a fundamental priority in our society. New opportunities for facilitating the dissemination of the remanufacturing approach, the dissemination of Product-Service Systems, or for increasing the lifetime of product (three ways for rationalizing materials) are proposed by the integration of upgrades which are functional enrichments brought to the product. This paper aims to show the need of product upgradability through a concrete study focused on four presuppositions: upgradability concept requires (P1) a potential pool of disposed devices which still work, (P2) a need for adaptability of product to user needs, (P3) a need for adaptability of product to the competition, and is related to (P4) an accumulation of product dissatisfactions over time. The first results show the necessity to consider a new sort of “evolutionary” products for sustainability: Innovations with multiples upgrade cycles.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper has two objectives: first, to introduce the concept of multimodal action-specific warnings and its prototypic realization in the form of a warning glove and second, to present the main findings of a user study that was conducted to test the warning glove against a conventional warning system. Regarding the first goal, the combination of multimodality and action-specificity was implemented by attaching electronic actuators on a right-handed glove for transmitting visual, auditory and tactile feedback. For the second objective, a user study was conducted to test the hypothesis that the warning glove is capable of obtaining faster responses and to determine the perceptions of the users regarding the appropriateness of the warning glove. The results confirmed the assumption of faster response times and participants perceived the warning glove to be ‘fairly appropriate’. These results warrant further development of this multimodal action-specific warning glove.

Abstract: Abstract
A Product-Service System (PSS) includes numerous human interactions that are critical factors for improving customer satisfaction. PSS providers, therefore, have to organise appropriate human resources from the viewpoint of customer requirements. This paper proposes an engineering method to select appropriate human resources for the PSS design. Specifically, a function formulated by the neural network is proposed to predict customer satisfaction realised by each human resource so that each human resource can be prioritised in terms of customer satisfaction. The application used in this study validated the prediction accuracy of the proposed function as well as the effectiveness for allocating human resources in PSS design.

Abstract: Abstract
Collaborative recommender systems offer a solution to the information overload problem found in online environments such as e-commerce. The use of collaborative filtering, the most widely used recommendation method, gives rise to potential privacy issues. In addition, the user ratings utilized in collaborative filtering systems to recommend products or services must be protected. The purpose of this research is to provide a solution to the privacy concerns of collaborative filtering users, while maintaining high accuracy of recommendations. This paper proposes a multi-level privacy-preserving method for collaborative filtering systems by perturbing each rating before it is submitted to the server. The perturbation method is based on multiple levels and different ranges of random values for each level. Before the submission of each rating, the privacy level and the perturbation range are selected randomly from a fixed range of privacy levels. The proposed privacy method has been experimentally evaluated with the results showing that with a small decrease of utility, user privacy can be protected, while the proposed approach offers practical and effective results.

For the last ten years, the notion of a green economy has become increasingly attractive to policy makers. However, green economy covers a lot of diverse concepts and its links with sustainability are not always clear. In this article, we focus on definitions of green economy and related concepts and an evaluation of these concepts against the criterion of strong and weak sustainability. The article serves three purposes: Firstly, we identify and describe diverse theories, concepts, approaches and tools related to a “green economy”. Among these are the theories of environmental economics and ecological economics, the concepts and approaches of cleaner production, waste hierarchy, bio-economy, industrial ecology, circular economy, nature-based solutions, and dematerialization through product-servicizing, and tools like life cycle assessment, and cost-benefit analysis. Secondly, we develop a framework that shows the capacity of the green economy concepts, approaches and tools to support the transition towards sustainability. Such a framework can serve as a heuristic to embed diverse concepts and approaches into a green economy framework. Thirdly, we briefly discuss green economy concepts with respect to their impact on strong and weak sustainability. Depending on the different concepts, approaches and tools identified in the green economy framework, different degrees of substitutability and trade-offs between environmental and economic benefits are allowed, and more or less structural changes of our modes of living are required. By discussing the notion of green economy and related concepts, approaches and tools we seek to make a contribution to their definitions and relationships as a prerequisite for operationalizing green economy.

Abstract: Abstract
The adoption of production technologies is a major challenge for manufacturing companies. Despite the long term impact of decisions on production technologies, companies are often unaware how to search for alternative production technologies. We developed a method that focusses on the systematic search for production technologies for fulfilling future manufacturing tasks. The method consists of three steps including the selection of information sources, information search and information evaluation. It takes advantages of the concept of technology lifecycles. The method provides a useful tool for producing companies and has been applied exemplary in the automotive industry.

Abstract: Abstract
Quality affects the performance of the product or service as well as customer satisfaction. This fact is genuinely important when it comes to how the consumer interprets the satisfaction that service provides and the judgment of the buying process as a whole. Considering that, service quality is an abstract and elusive construct due to three characteristics of services: intangibility, heterogeneity, and inseparability of production and consumption. In that way, we define service quality as perceived by the customer. In addition, the perceived quality is the comparison between the perception and customer expectation. Customer expectations are the expected service, arising from needs. However, these can be more or less demanding than the real needs. Perceptions are how the customer perceives the service provided, assessing whether this was appropriate or not. Thus, for service providing organizations the interpretation of customer needs is critical. Superior performance in services strengthens competitiveness and establishes a relationship with the customer, consolidating the brand and communication with the market, etc. This paper aims to evaluate the quality of a large hotel through the fuzzy SERVQUAL and fuzzy AHP. The results showed that the services have many gaps to be improved.

Abstract: Abstract
The diamond gemstone industry is characterized by a highly fragmented value chain and its reliance on skilled craftspeople. Since the Middle Ages, the city of Antwerp in Belgium has been a global center for diamond cutting and polishing, but over the last decades a major share of the production has shifted towards new cutting and polishing centers in Asia, predominantly in India and China, due to the fact that these processes are very labor intensive. A recent technological innovation, grain independent polishing (GIP), allows polishing diamonds independent of the polishing direction in a cold process, such that for the first time in history a fully automatic diamond polishing process becomes a possibility. One possible valorization scenario of this technological innovation is the development of an Product-Service System (PSS) business model, whereby a service center is set up in Antwerp that provides a diamond cutting and polishing service charged “per finished carat”. This scenario has been investigated in a case study described in this article, whereby the added value of GIP has been analyzed in a stochastic simulation model. The effects on cost as well as lead time, quality and risks have been evaluated and a sensitivity analysis has been performed. Estimates for the input parameters were gathered through structured interviews with diamond processing companies and industry experts. The described case study illustrates how the economic feasibility of a PSS business model can be investigated in a structured way and shows how the global competitiveness of a novel manufacturing concept can be analyzed during a technological innovation project.

Abstract: Abstract
Confronted with the accelerated product obsolescence and the resulting waste of materials, the concept of “optimised/increased/hybridised upgradability” is considered. In the literature, upgradability is used to respond to local technical problems (updating norms, update because of a broken component etc.) or as an end-of-life option. In our view however, it constitutes the heart of a new and promising paradigm of production/consumption. This paper proposes to consider hybrid systems that are called “Upgradable Product Service System (Up-PSS)” combining upgradability with optimised maintenance, with valorisation of end-of-life parts and with the servicisation of the offer. The promises of increasing attractiveness for clients, new businesses for manufacturers and a host of environmental benefits make this new concept highly pertinent compared to known models of production/consumption such as remanufacturable products, easily recyclable products, PSS, optimal maintenance products or basic upgrade products. Moreover, Up-PSS is a new opportunity to switch to offers without ownership transfer that facilitates the implementation of circular economy. In order to shed light on the field of Up-PSS and investigate the boundaries of this new paradigm, three actions are carried out: (1) focus groups with consumers and workshops with two manufacturers (2) on the upgradability of real products and (3) on the changes in business models. Our action research approach resulted in clarifying this new concept of the product by defining key ideas based on three keystones: (i) upgrades should be scheduled according to regular cycles of successive lines of functional improvements to satisfy the following themes of value creation: utilitarian, emotional, ethical, and service-oriented. There should also be specific upgrades chosen from a catalogue; (ii) the effects are strong environmental gains from multiple principles of rationalisation materials use but also by encouraging users to eco-friendly usage of their products; this is formalised by an eco-score to which both users and producers are committed. (iii) The above are accompanied by continuous interaction between clients and manufacturers through a web platform, offers of upgradable systems that would integrate bundles of services resulting in the system's growing attractiveness in the eyes of clients. This in turn would set in motion new modes of contracts, offering manufacturers new and more frequent ways of earning revenue; this would be conditional on setting up an upgradability support service that would be attractive to clients as well as reorganising the value chain with the participation of new partners. This transformation of the value network over time implies developing new development paths for business models to facilitate the transition from current economic models centred on material goods to models that are more service oriented.

Abstract: Abstract
This article examines opportunities and challenges of combining Integrated Product and Service Offerings (IPSOs) (also known as PSS) with Industrial Symbiosis (IS) in order to facilitate an increased utilization of Excess Heat (EH). This is done by an investigation of ten different EH examples. The results indicate that the main opportunities are associated with how the IPSO and IS perspectives complement each other, and how this combination increases the understanding of both the practical and organizational factors related to EH supply collaborations. Since all EH supply collaborations are unique, they require customized solutions and thereby flexible IPSO providers. The results show that the need for an IPSO provider with knowledge of heat distribution is highest in examples where the district heating sector does not constitute one of the two original actors. Still, the benefits of a neutral third party have also proved to be desirable in examples where the district heating sector is involved.

Abstract: Solutions to the economic and environmental impacts of the automotive industry have largely focused on technological innovation at the level of products or processes. This paper argues that, in order to achieve sustainability, change processes must be undertaken at the functional and systemic level.

The concept of product-service systems (PSS) represents a valuable opportunity to introduce such changes. PSS is predicated on new forms of product ownership, stewardship, design and producer–consumer interaction. The challenge now is to investigate ways in which the PSS concept might be introduced at the empirical level.

The paper suggests that the adoption of micro-factory retailing (MFR) ideas offer a means of introducing such a system-level change in the automotive industry. MFR is based on novel approaches to vehicle design that facilitate the economic viability of small-scale localised manufacturing sites. It is argued that such an approach to vehicle production, allows the adoption of a full scale PSS at local levels. Furthermore, via aspects such as the unification of the commerce and manufacturing function, and the proximity of manufacturing and servicing sites to users, the MFR approach may also offer distinct advantages compared with prevailing visions of PSS.

Abstract: Abstract
The un-sustainable course of our societies is the greatest threat humanity has ever confronted. The biophysical systems upon which we are totally dependent have not been challenged by human activities at the global scale before and our impacts upon those planetary systems, as well as upon our social systems, cannot be adequately addressed by ad hoc solutions. Science and leadership will be required to address this threat and transform our current societies into sustainable societies. This Special Volume presents an evolving, yet increasingly cohesive, science-based perspective on leadership towards sustainability. Examples of crucial, overall questions addressed by authors of articles in this Special Volume are: How can science help to clarify sustainability as a foundational platform for success for society's core institutions (e.g. business, governance and education), and how can this platform inform envisioning, planning, monitoring, communication and decision making to accelerate the needed transitions? The conceptual framing of sustainable development in this Special Volume is based upon the logic that it is only if we can define sustainability in a scientifically solid way, as a frame for any vision, that we can analyze current situations in relation to such sustainable visions, and design strategies to close the gap to such visions. In moving from current situations towards possible sustainable futures, specific support in the form of leadership concepts, methods, tools, and requirements are also essential, i.e. given clarity around what needs to be achieved, effective leadership then requires knowing how to achieve it. Both the what and the how questions are addressed in this Special Volume. The research described provides a foundation for moving from ad hoc activities to systemic, systematic and strategic transitions towards sustainability.

Abstract: Abstract
Increasing competitive pressure within industries producing long-living, cost intensive products drive the need to optimize product life cycles in terms of faster time to market, sustainable operation, reengineering and recycling. In this context, complexity of IT systems is growing and has to connect different life cycle phases. Especially new concepts of Product Service Systems (PSS) lead to a connection between product design, maintenance, repair and overhaul (MRO). There are still many challenges concerning interface problems between different IT-Systems. They are caused by different data formats, continuous demand for information or integration of new technologies. Thus, Life Cycle Engineering (LCE) has gained an important role and needs to consider integration of new industry 4.0 solutions like cloud services, big data or cyber physical systems. This paper gives an overview about these challenges, future development and new research approaches. A deeper view is taken at one promising approach in the field of maintenance of Printed Circuit Boards (PCB). This approach is about invention and implementation of a new process that combines both electrical and optical measuring techniques to automate circuit and layout plan reconstruction of long-living and cost intensive electronic boards.

Abstract: Abstract
The last decade has seen a remarkable uptake of interactive systems, products and services. Their design requires a shift from the traditional skills of material product-focused designers. We argue that the creativity in designing these information-enriched products needs to stress both physical properties and interactivity. The challenge is finding an educational approach that can equip industrial design graduates with stronger creativity instead of overstating the awareness of new technologies. This approach should extend rather than replace the knowledge, skills and experience from traditional design education. Using Monash University as the test bed, Tangible Interaction Design Education (TIDE), the cornerstone of this pedagogical model, provides an approach that blurs the boundaries between tangible objects and intangible services.

Abstract: Abstract
Since the 1990s, Product Service Systems (PSS) have been heralded as one of the most effective instruments for moving society towards a resource-efficient, circular economy and creating a much-needed ‘resource revolution’. This paper reviews the literature on PSS in the last decade and compares the findings with those from an earlier review in this journal in 2006. Close to 300 relevant papers were identified, over 140 of which have been referenced in this review. Research in the field of PSS has become more prolific, with the output of refereed papers quadrupling since 2000, while on average scientific output has only doubled. PSS has also become embedded in a wider range of science fields (such as manufacturing, ICT, business management, and design) and geographical regions (Asia now produces more papers than Europe). The literature of the last seven years has refined insights with regard to the design of PSS, as well as their business and environmental benefits, and confirmed the definitions and PSS concepts already available in 2006. A major contribution of the recent literature is research into how firms have implemented PSS in their organization and what the key success factors and issues that require special attention are (such as a focus on product availability for clients; an emphasis on diversity in terms of services provided rather than the range of products; and the need for staff to possess both knowledge of the product and relationship management skills). The reasons why PSS have nonetheless still not been widely implemented, particularly in the B2C context, seem to have already been explained fairly well in the literature available in 2006. For consumers, having control over things, artifacts, and life itself is one of the most valued attributes. PSS are often less accessible, or have less intangible value, than the competing product, in part because PSS usually do not allow consumers as much behavioral freedom or even leave them with the impression that the PSS provider could prescribe how they should behave.

Abstract: Abstract
It is increasingly acknowledged that, in order to achieve sustainability, there is an urgent need for radical and transformative restructuring of socio-technical systems that meet our needs. These transformations are referred to as system innovations for sustainability or transitions. Transitions and system innovations cover not only product and process innovations but also changes in user practices, markets, policy, regulations, culture, infrastructure, lifestyle and management of firms and have significant implications for design and innovation activity aiming to contribute to the societal endeavour of achieving sustainability. Even though theory on system innovations and transitions is now extensive, it provided explanations regarding how companies and design and innovation activities fit into the big and long-term picture of system innovations and transitions only to a certain extent. In addition, there have not been many efforts in the design for sustainability field to learn from the theories of transitions and system innovations. In this paper, we make an initial theoretical contribution into the design and innovation for sustainability field by integrating relevant insights from sustainability science and system innovations and transitions theories. The result of this integration is a proposal for a prescriptive conceptual framework which explains how wider-scale systemic changes can be addressed at smaller elements of socio-technical systems specifically focussing on the design and innovation level within companies.

Abstract: Abstract
The problem of personnel and interventions scheduling faced by a container ship maintenance service provider (MSPC), commonly the manufacturer of a main ship subsystem such as engines, is analysed. Clients can make a request for a maintenance service of a containership at a given harbour with a given number of days in advance to the desired date, as established in the service contract. The MSPC is allowed to delay the intervention to any future stop of the route within a specified time window depending on its urgency, as set in the contract. The MSPC technicians can be divided into different categories of skills and further distinguished as belonging to the MSPC main company, to the MSP network of subsidiaries, or hired on demand, with different availability constraints, personnel costs, and transport costs in relation to harbour proximity. Delays on planned arrival dates to harbours as well as changes in the duration of stay are common due to bad meteorological conditions, congestions at harbours, or other issues arisen during sailing or previous stops, so a rolling planning horizon should be adopted to face such a dynamic environment.

A Constraint Programming optimisation model hybridized with Large Neighborhood Search is proposed in order to address the problem and its performance compared to actual plans from a world-wide known MSPC. The model has been developed to perform also as a decision making tool; a factorial design of experiment is adopted in order to analyse the impact of a change in some contractual features, such as the minimum time allowed to clients for requiring a service, or the maximum delay allowed to the MSPC to satisfy a service request. How granting clients more flexibility while preserving efficacy and efficiency of the service can so be investigated.

Abstract: Abstract
The growing trend for delivering physical products to customers as parts of product service systems (PSS) is creating a need for a new generation of Computer Aided Design (CAD) system to support the design of PSS: so-called “PSS-CAD”. Key research issues in the development of such systems include building understanding of the kinds of applications that designers of PSS might need and the establishment of well-founded representation schemes to underpin and support communication between PSS-CAD systems. Recent literature includes numerous descriptions of integrated PSS development processes, PSS-CAD tools to support these processes and early meta-models to provide information support. This paper complements this work by proposing a representation scheme that is a key prerequisite to achieving the interoperability between PSS-CAD systems which would be necessary to support the deployment of integrated PSS development processes in industry.

The representation scheme, a form of meta-model, draws on learning from the product definition community that emerged in the 1970s in response to a need for interoperability between the different shape-based CAD systems that were being developed at the time. The initial focus on shape representation has developed to digital product definitions that define the design of a product coupled with meta-data recording details of processes by which the design was created and, more recently, supported through-life. Similarly, PSS-related information includes both PSS definitions, to support the lifecycles of physical products and associated services, and meta-data needed to support the management of PSS development processes.

This paper focuses on information requirements for the definition of service elements of PSS and relationships with product elements and service actors. These requirements are derived from earlier work on the use of service blueprinting for the visualisation and mapping of service activities to deliver different types of service contract. Key information requirements addressed include the need to represent service process flow and breakdown structures, relationships between service and product elements, substitution relationships, and service variants. A representation scheme is proposed and demonstrated through application to a PSS case study. The representation scheme is built on a generic information architecture that has already been applied to problems of product definition; as such there is an underlying compatibility that offers real promise in the future realisation of integrated PSS development processes.

Abstract: Abstract
SMEs need to innovate in services in order to survive and to create value. Service SMEs are facing the challenge of offering their customers continuously improved or completely new services and hence require service innovations to achieve and sustain competitive advantage. We used service value creation capability to assess service innovation capability of SMEs. Service value creation capability is a holistic approach which consists of Strategic capability, Managerial capability, Organizational capability and Adaptive capability to transform an SME into a value creation SME. It offers an overview of service value creation capability and activities against which service SMEs can critically reflect their service innovation performance. Our research primary focus is to explore and to find the relationship of service value creation capability with service innovation capability and to assess the service innovation by using a proposed model for service value creation capability. The model is empirically validated in Danish and Turkish SMEs to identify the correlation between the service value creation and service innovation through an integrated service value creation capability model analysis. The empirical data analysis reveals that there is strong positive correlation between the SME's service innovation capability and service value creation capability (strategic capability, managerial capability, operational capability and adaptive capability).

Abstract: Abstract
This paper aims to present a modeling of bike sharing demand at station level in the city of Lyon. Robust linear regression models were used in order to predict the flows of each station. The data used in this project consists of over 6 million bike sharing trips recorded in 2011. The built environment variables used in the model are determined in a buffer zone of 300 meters around each bike sharing station. In order to estimate the bike sharing flow, we use the method of linear regression during the peak periods of a weekday. The results show that bike sharing is principally used for commuting purposes by long term subscribers while short term subscriber's trips purposes are more varied. The combination between bike sharing and train seems to be an important inter-modality. An interesting finding is that student is an important user of bike sharing. We found that there were different types of bikesharing usage which are influenced by socio-economic factors depending on the period within the day and type of subscribers. The present findings could be useful for others cities which want to adopt a bikesharing system and also for a better planning and operation of existing systems. Further, the solutions to encourage the use of bikesharing will be various depending on type of subscribers. The approach in this paper can be useful for estimating car-sharing demand.

Abstract: Abstract
In order to deal with resource shortage and environmental deterioration, product service system (PSS) are proposed as a sustainable development concept. Careful evaluation in the earlier design stages must be performed before putting a PSS design solution into practice in order to guarantee the sustainability. Due to the reason that sustainability involves many factors and PSS is a complex system with long lifespan, the sustainability criteria will be of great quantity and various measurements. This paper aims to deal with two issues: (1) how to choose the sustainability criteria (2) and how to deal with uncertain factors when measuring these criteria. The zigzag mapping process is adopted to help decision makers to obtain criteria from the customer domain to function domain. The customer domain is modified to include the economic, environmental and social aspects of sustainability. To deal with uncertain factors, the Information Axiom is extended in the hybrid uncertain environments characterized by fuzziness and randomness co-existing. The design range is modeled as a fuzzy variable and the system range is modeled as a random variable. Thus the information content calculating involves integrals with fuzzy boundaries. A fuzzy simulation algorithm is constructed to calculate this kind of integrals. Two case studies are illustrated to highlight the effectiveness and accuracy of the proposed approach. The results show that the proposed method could reflect the judgements of decision makers more precisely, and make use of evaluation information more comprehensively. The results also show that use-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the social aspect of sustainability, while product-oriented PSS is easy to be influenced by the economic aspect of sustainability.

Abstract: Efficient waste management is necessary in order to face up to increasing quantities of waste generated in modern societies. A technical solution using a Machine-to-Machine (M2M) enhanced Product-Service System (PSS) for bring-in waste glass collection is identified. Methodology based on Life Cycle Analysis (LCA) is proposed. The results help understand the mechanisms of M2M PSS. Possible improvements are explored and the study shows how the PSS infrastructure impacts the environment. It examines the influence of major organisational parameters and contributes to eco-design and dimensioning of the M2M PSS. It reveals the interest of mutualisation to reduce environmental impacts and shows the importance of limiting data exchanges. It argues for the use of multi-criteria LCA on the complete system including the telecom infrastructures and employs realistic use scenarios derived from field studies.

Abstract: Rethinking the role consumption plays in individual well-being and societal development is key for addressing pressing environmental problems. We perceive the need to envision consumption as a social activity, which requires the active engagement of consumers in order to better enhance their quality of life. The paper focuses on the framework of Product Service Systems, one particular programme for more sustainable consumption. After reviewing the potential benefits and limitations of this programme, we explore the opportunities to learn from participatory and community-based strategies like LETS.

Abstract: Abstract
Textiles can be applied in a wide variety of aircrafts' components and it is known for its highly polluting dyes, short life-cycle and small concern with end of life. Combined with the aeronautic emissions, the textile industry represents a clear threat to the environment, but it also represents opportunities. In order to promote sustainability in the completion industry, the product development process is of central importance. A large number of general approaches and methods for the development of sustainable products has been proposed and used in the literature, but how they can be integrated to improve the design process in the Green Aircraft Completion (GAC) sector is an open research question. This paper was developed from this question and it reviews and analyses several design methods and eco-design approaches from the literature in order to propose a novel integrative conceptual framework for the GAC. This framework is then applied in a large North American company so that it could be tested and improved. This experience allowed the researchers to verify whether the development of new textiles in the studied company comply with the sustainable frameworks and good practices proposed by the literature. Empirical evidences also indicate that the proposed framework would enable companies in the GAC and aeronautic industry to develop systems involving the final consumer, suppliers and the local communities; not only decreasing its carbon footprint, but also improving the company's corporate social responsibility.

Abstract: Abstract
De**sign has a great role to play in sustainability. Interesting progresses has been performed within the last decades. Nevertheless, some issues of sustainability, and their impact on design, remains poorly studied. Specifically, when it comes to the field of local value creation, the literature in design is still limited. However, the Local Value Creation (LVC) thinking can be a great insight for designers to develop more eco-innovative concepts, through new product design, new services and new business models. In order to go towards this direction, it is necessary to include new variables that are rarely considered in design processes such as the local workforce, sustainable local resources or the customization of the new product or service for local customers.

This paper proposes a better understanding of the relation between eco-design approaches and LVC, and more precisely how current eco-design approaches consider this issue. To do so, a first part introduces the Local Value Creation concept and its challenges for sustainability. Then, a second part focuses on a literature review to understand how the LVC dimension is studied in the eco-design process. This will lead in a third section to concretely characterize how eco-design approaches and tools consider LCV issue.A last section proposes to identify potential contradiction between the LVC and the eco-design concept, in order to draw first outlines of a new eco-design paradigm with a Local Value Creation dimension.

Abstract: As a means for providing the sustainable production and consumption, the concept of product-service system (PSS) has received increasing attention. What is at the core in the PSS is the design, since it determines the distinctive characteristics and quality of PSS. Even though some tools have been suggested for PSS design, previous tools mainly focus on identifying the relationship between actors in a conceptual level. Despite the fact that it is significant and cannot be neglected, what is more important in a practical situation is to represent the detailed flow or relationship of PSS elements, with the consideration of products and services. In response, this paper proposes a ‘‘product-service blueprint’ which is a new and systematic way to elucidate the relationship between products and services, providing the implication of how PSS can provide the sustainable production and consumption. Employing the service blueprint as a starting point, new areas, lines, and symbols are introduced to represent the distinctive features of PSS. The proposed product-service blueprint represents the product use throughout the life cycle, service flow from the management to the customer, and the relationship between products and services. Taken together, the product-service blueprint will help both managers and researchers to promote the product-service integration under the concrete framework.

Abstract: One of the key challenges of energy access in emerging markets and developing countries is how to reach households and communities that are unlikely to get a grid connection in the long term or those that are connected to the grid but suffer from regular blackouts or low voltage. By surveying entrepreneurs selling Solar Home Systems (SHSs) on a commercial basis in emerging and developing countries, this study is one of the first attempts to quantify the key elements of four potential Product Service Systems (PSSs): Cash, Credit, Leasing and Fee-for-Service. Whereas the Fee-for-Service approach was found to be suitable only under certain conditions, all PSSs share two key elements for successful market deployment: one or more years of maintenance, and customer support in financing these customers' new asset. Moreover, it appears that private sector companies are in principle able to deliver SHSs to households with incomes greater than USD 1000 per year. The implications for policy makers and development aid agencies are, first, to include maintenance services into public programmes or public–private partnerships and, second, to explicitly consider financial risks for entrepreneurs (e.g., customer commitment and repayment conditions).

Abstract: Abstract
Prior research has demonstrated that design for disassembly enables higher recovery rates for precious and critical metals, as well as flame retardant plastics from End-of-Life (EoL) electronics. However, small EoL electronic products are nowadays commonly recycled in a size-reduction based treatment or can be directly treated in an integrated Precious Metal (PM) smelter-refinery. In this article, a methodology is described to calculate the Rate of Return (RoR) on investing in fasteners which can be simultaneously released by the application of an external trigger, following the principle of active disassembly. This methodology is used in the presented case study to calculate the ROR of implementing a pressure sensitive snap-fit in an electronic payment terminal which is sold in a product service system business model. In addition, the economic and environmental performances of an active disassembly based EoL treatment is compared with those of a manual disassembly and a size-reduction based treatment, as well as direct treatment in an integrated PM smelter-refinery. Results of the presented case study demonstrate that the ROR on investing in active fasteners for the case study product is 27%.

Abstract: The present paper discusses Life Cycle Simulation (LCS) as a new approach for supporting the design of Product–Service Systems. The increased relevance of the life cycle perspective in modern society calls for more sustainable approaches to design, engineer and construct everyday products and related services. To respond to such a need, designers and engineers may have access to new methods and tools that are able to integrate the life cycle perspective in a proper way. In such a context, simulation – in its wider meaning – could play a relevant role for engineering the life cycle of a product and analyzing the related service networks. Within this context, the paper conducts a state of the art review of existing solutions implementing LCS, in order to identify common characteristics and prioritize next steps to be done for a comprehensive implementation. To this end a reference architecture is proposed.

Abstract: Abstract
In this paper, we propose a new method called 2-probabilities focused combination for combining information about user preferences on products or services in recommender systems based on Dempster–Shafer theory. Regarding this method, in focal sets of mass functions representing user preferences, focal elements with probabilities in top two highest ones are retained and the remaining focal elements are considered as noise and then transferred to the whole set element. To demonstrate the advantages of the new method, a baseline known as 2-points focused combination is selected for performance comparison in a range of experiments using Movielens and Flixster data sets. According to the results of experiments, the new method is more effective in accuracy of recommendations and comparable in computational time. Also, the new method is capable of overcoming the weakness of the baseline because of the ability to generate stable results.

Abstract: The roles of customers from passive users to collaborators in creating and extracting business value have given rise to customer co-creation techniques and value co-creation models. Although these techniques and models have been useful to researchers and businesses, they are unstructured. A classification is necessary so that research can be placed in proper context of one another. Via an examination of the literature and based on the concept of customer value hierarchy a classification of the different models and techniques of co-creation is developed. There are two implications for the classification. Firstly, it will aid in the research and understanding of the use of the various techniques and models. Secondly, it can assist in designing appropriate encounter processes as a basis for engaging customers and subsequently provide innovation for organizations. The paper concludes with an application of the classification to develop encounter processes in a learning management system.

Abstract: The co-evolution of industrial production and social patterns calls for systemic solutions that can only be provided by partnerships between companies and other stakeholders, including final users. Such partnerships are defined as Solution Oriented Partnerships (or SOP). Product Service Systems (PSS) are the catalyser of such solutions. The capability of PSS to become an attractive solution depends on factors that are commonly considered to belong to the design domain. The role of designers is therefore essential to the definition of effective and attractive PSS. Designers are now urged to find their own methodological approach to the design of PSS. This paper addresses this need by proposing methods to define a map of the actors involved in PSS, methods to define requirements and structure of a PSS and methods to represent and blueprint a PSS.

Abstract: Product–Service Systems (PSS) and Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) have so far been researched individually in different domains and as unrelated research theme. However, to guarantee the availability of the asset, which is a typical demand in some PSS contracts, it is fundamental for PSS providers to be able to properly manage the asset's lifetime variability in order to avoid unscheduled downtimes and contract penalties. This paper describes part of a research project to investigate how PHM can support more effective fulfilment of some PSS contracts. In particular, this paper aims to present a novel framework to link PHM and PSS using online simulation. The paper also presents a prototype of the online simulation model and three experimental cases comparing the outcomes of the online simulation model against those obtained from the traditional simulation model.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainable business is characterized by its facets to balance triple bottom lines (i.e., profit, planet, and people). In sustainable business design, it is crucial to consider interaction between the core business and external environment, which does not seem to influence the profit of the core business but necessary to explain their intended environmental and social value proposition. To construct a particular model of sustainable business, the paper conducted a survey on the study of business models and, in particular, sustainable business models (e.g., eco-innovations, sustainable innovations, product-service systems). The survey focuses on how the study models external environment and its influences on the core business characterized by “externality”. Through discussion on the findings of the literature review, three key issues to be addressed for constructing sustainable business model are identified: taxonomy of externality, identification of a set of models (i.e., aspect model), and identification of interrelationship among them. First and second issues clarify particular aspects of externality. By considering third issue, the designer is able to design sustainable business by integrating these aspects.

Abstract: Abstract
Failure mode and effect analysis (FMEA) is a prospective risk assessment technique broadly used in various industries for enhancing the safety and reliability of systems, products, processes and services. Nonetheless, when the traditional FMEA is applied in actual situations, it exposes some important insufficiencies, especially in the evaluation of failure modes, the weighting of risk factors, and the ranking of failure modes. Therefore, in this paper, a new FMEA model which integrates COmplex PRoportional ASsessment (COPRAS) and analytic network process (ANP) method is proposed to assess and rank the risk of failure modes under interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy context. The proposed risk priority approach combines the advantages of interval-valued intuitionistic fuzzy sets (IVIFSs) in coping with uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness, and the merits of COPRAS and ANP in solving multi-criteria decision making problems. Finally, a practical case in hospital service setting is presented to illustrate the accuracy, effectiveness and flexibility of the proposed model.

Abstract: Abstract
Implementing practices for a circular economy transforms the way companies do business, notably in the manufacturing industry. However, a circular economy requires a transformation of both production and consumption systems; the standard approach for creation, fabrication, and commerce of products is challenged. Authors repeatedly call for the development of new proficiencies to attend to system transformations, but these so far have not been described for design and engineering. Given that the design of a product directly influences the way a value chain will be managed, building circular, globally sustainable value chains inevitably signifies a fundamental change in the practice of design. Comprehensive analyses were conducted on case studies from a variety of multinational enterprises that are transforming their product strategies for climate change. Changes in design processes were identified, revealing a growing necessity for industry to employ new proficiencies that support closure of material loops. This paper contributes to existing literature by depicting successful practices being implemented in industry. A variety of new capabilities are key to design for a sustainable future; these range from deeper knowledge of material composition to rich understanding of social behaviour. Resulting from this research, learning goals are proposed to serve as guidance for manufacturing companies seeking to tackle climate change. Conclusions aim to encourage researchers and academics to respond to emerging needs by re-thinking education in design and engineering.

Abstract: This article discusses developments in the area of product service systems (PSS) and the need to facilitate the proliferation of the PSS approach through public policies. The article argues that policies that establish the framework conditions for environmental improvement are preferable to detailed legislation as they favour environmentally superior PSS. However, there is also a need for more specifically targeted policy measures that stimulate knowledge creation and dissemination in the PSS area. This article suggests that informative policy measures should be used by authorities and reviews the results from the functional programme of the Swedish EPA as an example of this type of policy.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainability is a system property; therefore, products/services/technologies/organisations cannot be sustainable on their own but they may be elements of sustainable systems. In addition, to achieve sustainability, there is a requirement for transformation of socio-technical systems which fulfil certain social functions such as energy, mobility and food. The theoretical and practical approaches proposed so far in the broad field of design and innovation for sustainability have not satisfactorily addressed system level changes. This paper provides a critical review of approaches targeting different phases of design and innovation processes. The strengths/shortcomings of these approaches are analysed based on the criteria developed by integrating insights from sustainability science and system innovation/transition management theories. Based on the critical review, a future research agenda is suggested in following areas: exploration of synergies between existing approaches/tools/methods, development of a theoretical framework for design and innovation for sustainability with references to system innovation and transition management theories, and, development of new approaches/tools/methods for the use of design and innovation teams.

Abstract: Good combination of product and service is a key issue to balance economic growth with environmental concerns. This paper aims at demonstrating a design method to integrate products and service activities for total value. Our design method differs from Traditional Engineering and Concurrent Engineering in that products and service activities are designed in parallel according to customer value. To establish such design method, the service blueprinting method from marketing field, which describes service delivery processes, is extended to include product and its behavior. Function structure of service for the receiver state works as a bridge between product behavior and service activity. Both the above method and the CAD tool are demonstrated through an example presented herein.

Abstract: Abstract
When reconfigured into a cohesive system, a series of existing digital technologies may facilitate disassembly, take back and reuse of structural steel components, thereby improving resource efficiency and opening up new business paradigms. The paper examines whether Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology coupled with Building Information Modelling (BIM) may enable components and/or assemblies to be tracked and imported into virtual models for new buildings at the design stage. The addition of stress sensors to components, which provides the capability of quantifying the stress properties of steel over its working life, may also support best practice reuse of resources. The potential to improve resource efficiency in many areas of production and consumption, emerging from a novel combination of such technologies, is highlighted using a theoretical case study scenario. In addition, a case analysis of the demolition/deconstruction of a former industrial building is conducted to illustrate potential savings in energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions (GGE) from reuse when compared with recycling. The paper outlines the reasoning behind the combination of the discussed technologies and alludes to some possible applications and new business models. For example, a company that currently manufactures and 'sells' steel, or a third party, could find new business opportunities by becoming a 'reseller' of reused steel and providing a 'steel service'. This could be facilitated by its ownership of the database that enables it to know the whereabouts of the steel and to be able to warrant its properties and appropriateness for reuse in certain applications.

Abstract: A large perspective shift is informing corporate strategies in modern economies. Such strategies, once focused on product manufacture, are now aimed at providing product-service systems (PSS) i.e. systemic solutions including products and services.

Designers, who have usually focused their activity on material products, have rarely been involved in the debate about the development of such systems. The shift to PSS therefore, represents a challenge for designers, who now need to extend their traditional logical domain and to develop new methodological tools.

This paper explores such a shift, through a case study, the design of a telecentre.

Abstract: After acquiring USFilter Corporation, the Siemens I&amp;S Group amalgamated its products, systems, services and automation equipment for the water industry into a single segment — Water Technologies — to help it serve the heavily fragmented market place in various parts of the world. It says that better use must be made of water: reclamation and water cycle management secure the development of cities and regions. Continuing this month's theme of water and water treatment, here we briefly look at the role the company is playing, particularly in Latin America.

Abstract: Abstract
Successful inclusive product design requires knowledge about the capabilities, needs and aspirations of potential users and should cater for the different scenarios in which people will use products, systems and services. This should include: the individual at home; in the workplace; for businesses, and for products in these contexts. It needs to reflect the development of theory, tools and techniques as research moves on.

And it must also to draw in wider psychological, social, and economic considerations in order to gain a more accurate understanding of users' interactions with products and technology. However, recent research suggests that although a number of national disability surveys have been carried out, no such knowledge currently exists as information to support the design of products, systems and services for heterogeneous users. This paper outlines the strategy behind specific inclusive design research that is aimed at creating the foundations for measuring inclusion in product designs. A key outcome of this future research will be specifying and operationalising capability, and psychological, social and economic context measures for inclusive design. This paper proposes a framework for capturing such information, describes an early pilot study, and makes recommendations for better practice.

Abstract: This paper proposes methods to support PSS conceptual design. Especially, methods for supporting PSS ideas generation and evaluation are proposed. In the phase of PSS ideas generation, designers’ acquisition of new design solutions is enhanced by case-based knowledge offering. The generated ideas, subsequently, are evaluated from the viewpoints of both customer satisfaction and resource constraints. In this phase, the PSS ideas are prioritized for the purpose of maximizing customer satisfaction under the constraints of resources. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated by applying it to an example case.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays traditional manufacturers realize the growing importance of service provision, since a simple offering of stand-alone products makes a differentiation from increasing competition difficult. That is why manufacturing organizations turn out providing product-service systems, running through a specific organizational change process called servitization. While literature focuses on setting up appropriate organizational structures on an organizational level, it neglects recommendations helping organizations to overcome existing product orientation on the individual level of employees. The paper at hand presents a framework including the most important aspects a servitizing organization has to consider in dealing with the individual level of servitization.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents a condition monitoring and fault diagnostics (CMFD) system for hydropower plants (HPP). CMFD is based on the concept of industrial product-service systems (IPS2), in which the customer, turbine supplier, and maintenance service provider are the IPS2 stakeholders. The proposed CMFD consists of signal acquisition, data transfer to the virtual diagnostics center (VDC) and fault diagnostics. A support vector machine (SVM) classifier has been used for fault diagnostics. CMFD has been implemented on an HPP with three Kaplan units. A signal acquisition system for CMFD consists of data acquisition from a unit control system and a supplementary system for high-frequency data acquisition. The implemented SVM method exhibits high training accuracy and thus enables adequate fault diagnostics. The data are analyzed in the VDC, which allows all stakeholders access to diagnostic information from anywhere at any time. Based on this information, the service providers can establish condition-based maintenance and offer operational support. Furthermore, through the VDC, cooperation between the stakeholders can be achieved; thus, better maintenance scheduling is possible, which will be reflected in higher system availability.

Abstract: Abstract

Coping with evolution in automated production systems implies a cross-disciplinary challenge along the system's life-cycle for variant-rich systems of high complexity. The authors from computer science and automation provide an interdisciplinary survey on challenges and state of the art in evolution of automated production systems. Selected challenges are illustrated on the case of a simple pick and place unit. In the first part of the paper, we discuss the development process of automated production systems as well as the different type of evolutions during the system's life-cycle on the case of a pick and place unit. In the second part, we survey the challenges associated with evolution in the different development phases and a couple of cross-cutting areas and review existing approaches addressing the challenges. We close with summarizing future research directions to address the challenges of evolution in automated production systems.

Abstract: In the last decade, the concepts of customer satisfaction and customer retention have gained increasing importance in both online and off-line businesses. The primary objective of the present study is intended to ascertain the factors that affect online consumers’ satisfaction in Taiwan. In it, information quality, system quality, service quality, product quality, delivery quality and perceived price have been identified and taken as the antecedents of user satisfaction.

The present study, too, holds the key to unravelling how these factors may influence online consumers’ satisfaction. A survey was conducted with 390 Taiwan’s university undergraduates who had online purchase experience. Multiple regression techniques were used to verify the overall model fit and to illustrate online customers’ satisfaction. The results showed that online consumers’ satisfaction was positive and significant affected by information quality, system quality, service quality, product quality, delivery quality and perceived price at significant P ¡0.01 level. Moreover, delivery quality was the most important factor and followed by product quality. The evidence generated in the present study suggests that e-commerce operators should pay more attention on the product sourcing, and cooperate with the delivery supplier to provide a higher delivery quality such as correct order, on time, and safety package. The implications of this finding, among others, are thoroughly discussed in the concluding section.

Abstract: Today, since a single product is no longer sufficient to cope with the dynamic market environment, firms are trying to provide the integrated offering of products and services. However, despite the importance and utility of product–service integration, a limited approach has been conducted regarding the planning of the strategic management of integrated offering. To deal with this issue, this paper firstly suggests the concept and typology of technological interface in product–service integration. Based on the technological interface, a generic structure of product–service integrated roadmap is developed. Extended from the generic structure, this paper finally proposes the typological configurations of integrated roadmap according to the technological interface and investigates the usage, characteristics, and roadmapping processes.

Abstract: Abstract
Through-life engineering services depend on capabilities to track and trace long-living systems and their components throughout the lifecycle. System configurations need to be known to (re)engineer, build, operate, maintain, and dispose systems in a sustainable way. Configuration Management (CM) is an approach to control system configurations with dedicated engineering processes, methods and tools – today foremost supported by information systems. This paper motivates CM implementation for through-life engineering services and systems engineering and related topics such as PSS (Product-Service Systems) and MRO (Maintenance, Repair, and Overhaul). CM fundamentals and related engineering activities are introduced briefly. Different CM views and daily challenges of CM for long-living complex systems are investigated. Software support for CM is discussed on the basis of PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) solutions. The paper highlights points that need attention for CM implementation (CM data and process management) by means of PLM. The paper summarizes requirements for CM based on PDM/PLM solutions, which are relevant for PLM solution vendors and for engineering companies and manufacturers moving towards PSS and MRO. The paper is written form an engineering perspective.

Abstract: Abstract
As companies are concentrating on core competencies, they increasingly require their suppliers to provide full solutions rather than individual offerings. Many of these solutions, a specific one being “performance-based contracting” (PBC), require a systems integration approach from the providers, who strongly depend on their sub-suppliers’ contributions. Yet, while research on PBC is increasing and some implications for the customer–provider relationship have been identified, no study has been undertaken to analyse the implications of PBC on the upstream suppliers, specifically how the relationship is impacted by results-oriented concepts such as PBC, how suppliers are aligned to the PBC outcome and how they participate in the performance-based compensation. This paper seeks to address this gap, combining a theoretical approach and an empirical approach. The challenges resulting from PBC on the supplier relationships of PBC providers are first analysed from an information economics perspective. Then, a case study approach with insights from typical PBC industries such as defence or aerospace was used to validate and enhance the study. The findings show that despite opposing assumptions in previous literature, PBC suppliers are not involved into the concept’s specifics in a dedicated way, giving away the potentials of a proper alignment. Based on this, a governance portfolio model for the PBC providers’ supplier relationships is developed. The paper is concluded with managerial and theoretical implications.

Abstract: Abstract
Service damage for mechanical components includes surface delamination, impact damage, crack, wear and corrosion. Automated service damage identification for better analysis of a component remaining life in order to reduce the service cost is increasingly necessary for industrial product-service systems, e.g. power-by-hour contracts. This paper presents a novel approach to apply active thermography and image processing techniques for damage identification and measurement. The study presents experimental results to assess the shape, size and depth of sub-surface damage features on test and real life components. Industrial requirements for the non-destructive inspection for a class of aerospace components are also presented.

Abstract: Abstract
Recently, innovative products and services have been changing the way people live their lives. Human–computer interaction (HCI) plays an important role in the development and design of such products and services. However, prior studies did not fully explain how people evaluate their experience when they use a product and service. The research goal of this study is to propose a conceptual model that explains the judgment of experience quality and the judgment criteria. This study suggested two research questions: First, how can we understand users' judgment of good experience? We will suggest a theoretical model that is based on the concept of locus of control (LoC) for explaining users' evaluation of their experience, including the use result and the use process. Second, what are the representative system factors to affect users’ judgment? This study validates the representative system factors that affect the determinants through verifying the conceptual model. Through a pre-study, the representative system features affecting each determinant were derived and hypothesized for the main study. The results showed that experiential LoC was affected both internally and externally by the two determinants. In addition, each of the determinants was affected by the dimension or level of the system features.

Abstract: This paper proposes ISCL, Integrated Service CAD and Life cycle simulator. ISCL plays the role of CAD/CAE tools for product design in Product Service Systems (PSSs) design. In ISCL, the service CAD supports systematic generation of alternative PSSs based on service modeling, and the life cycle simulator analyzes their economic and environmental performances. The current study applies ISCL to the design of a PSS that includes functional upgrading service of a product, whose life cycle costs are sensitive to both its functional obsolescence and physical deterioration. Performances of alternative PSSs are investigated under different market and technology conditions.

Abstract: Abstract
Cyber-Physical-Social Systems integrate various resources from physical network, cyberspace, and social world.These systems rely on communication, computation and control infrastructures commonly consisting of several levels for the three worlds with various resources as sensors, actuators, computational resources, services, humans, etc. Efficient interaction of these resources is essential for cyber-physical-social systems operation. The paper presents multi-level self-organization approach for cyber-physical-social systems that distinguishes three main level for the system resource interaction: physical level, planning level, and strategic level. Smart home cleaning scenariois proposedas an example of multi-level self-organization approach. Robot vacuum cleaner creates room map using the light-sensitive sensors and clean room using the map. For the efficient cleaning, it requires the lights switch on in the cleaning room. For this purposes the vacuum cleaner has to interact with the adaptive illumination control system.Manipulating robot move light furniture (e.g. chairs, or coffee table) or decorative elements (pots with flowers, vases, etc.). It interacts with the vacuum cleaner for synchronization of moving light furniture.For the strategic level, a special strategic planning service has been identified that determines general strategy of resources behavior in the scenario based on interaction with personal mobile device and current situation in smart home. Example of general strategies can be for example reduction in energy consumption, excellent cleaning. For the planning level, a special room management services have been proposed that provide general behavior the cyber-physical-social systems resources in physical level. Example of these strategies can be clean room 1 completely, after that clean room 2 or vice versa. For the physical level a vacuum cleaner, manipulating, and light control services have been proposed. The paper present ontology-based information model for smart home devices interaction. It allows the services of physical level linked to the appropriate smart room devices interact in cyber space while physical devices interact in physical space. Every resource in physical level of cyber-physical-social system is described by the ontology. Appropriate ontologies of vacuumcleanerrobot, adaptive illumination control system, and manipulating robothave been proposed in the paper.

Abstract: The Internet creates excellent opportunities for businesses to provide personalized online services to their customers. Recommender systems are designed to automatically generate personalized suggestions of products/services to customers. Because various uncertainties exist within both product and customer data, it is a challenge to achieve high recommendation accuracy. This study develops a hybrid recommendation approach which combines user-based and item-based collaborative filtering techniques with fuzzy set techniques and applies it to mobile product and service recommendation. It particularly implements the proposed approach in an intelligent recommender system software called Fuzzy-based Telecom Product Recommender System (FTCP-RS). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and the initial application shows that the FTCP-RS can effectively help customers to select the most suitable mobile products or services.

Abstract: Abstract
The research presented in this paper pursues two main goals. Empirically, it aims to explore sectoral futures at European level in a range of different sectors (automotive, construction, textile, KIBS, wholesale &amp; retail), to identify cross-cutting patterns of sectoral change, and to highlight implications that these may raise for European innovation policy. In order to do this in a systematic manner, it also has a conceptual and methodological ambition, namely to devise a sectoral innovation foresight methodology that builds explicitly on concepts derived from sectoral innovation systems approaches. This theory-led methodology allows exploring and interpreting future developments at sectoral level in a coherent and comparable manner. Technologies and knowledge, actors and organisations, user needs and demand, as well as institutional and policy frameworks are taken into account; elements that need to co-evolve for any innovation system scenario to unfold. This conceptual framework is translated into a sector innovation foresight methodology that was used to guide a multi-sector foresight initiative.

Based on a meta-analysis of insights from five different sectors, cross-sectoral patterns of future change as well as cross-cutting policy issues are pointed out. Three areas of cross-cutting changes have been identified: a) the shift from products to systems and services, b) blurring boundaries between sectors, and c) sectoral and cross-sectoral integration of sustainability demands, and the governance of interactions between sectors.

Foresight projects at sectoral level have been conducted rarely as compared to technology-centered or societal-issue centered foresights or retrospective sectoral innovation system studies. By relying explicitly on a theoretical framework of sectoral innovation systems, this paper explores the potential of better linking innovation theory to policy- and strategy-oriented foresight.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper quantifies environmental and economic benefits of the Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO) in real practice from a life cycle perspective, in comparison with its corresponding product-sales type business as a reference. The paper also discusses the engineering activities contributing to those effects, as well as their enablers. To reach this goal, the paper investigates three IPSOs as real-life business cases in industry. Those cases are selected from different sectors and have different characteristics. In addition, the paper calculates and compares environmental impacts and economic costs of different offerings in each case through the use of Life Cycle Assessment and Life Cycle Costing, respectively. In all three cases, IPSOs had environmental and economic advantages in comparison with the product-sales type business. The engineering activities contributing to those advantages under IPSOs were recycling, remanufacturing, reuse, maintenance, and holistic planning and operation. The enablers were found to be high flexibility for realizing products and services and close relationships with relevant actors.

Abstract: Abstract
South Korea has the highest expenditure on telecommunications among OECD countries, drawing national attention to the issue of reducing high prices. In response, the Korean government enacted the Mobile Device Distribution Improvement (MDDI) Act to eliminate information asymmetry by limiting mobile carriers’ mobile handset subsidies to consumers. This study examined factors affecting public trust in the MDDI based by analyzing responses to a questionnaire survey using the ordered probit model. The results show that the knowledge, expectations, and perceived effects of the MDDI have a meaningful effect on public trust in the policy. The results of this study confirm that it is essential for governments to promote their policies by continuously educating the public, especially in this case because the policy has a direct effect on telecommunications expenditures.

Abstract: Cross-disciplinary research programmes often entail an integrative goal, that is, to integrate theory and findings from the multiple disciplines involved in the research. Services research has been frequently described as existing in silos. Little has been put forwards towards remedying this beyond the view that one theoretical perspective could dominate the discipline. This paper presents a framework for systematically relating streams services research.

Working from the view that services are consistently defined as activities, rather than objects or artefacts the concepts of the framework are drawn from Activity Modelling approaches (e.g. Task Analysis, Domain/Process modelling, and Soft Systems).

Abstract: Abstract
Bioplastics play an increasingly important role for consumer products. These new materials might increase product sustainability but they are currently confined to niche markets. While research has gained important insight into the technical challenges, few studies to date explore the behavioral aspects for product developers as they move to employ bioplastics in their development efforts. This manuscript reports the findings of a grounded inductive study based on interview data with 32 product developers in the consumer goods industry. The Theory of Planned Behavior is employed to guide the research and provide a theoretical background to derive implications. The study finds that behavioral challenges impede the increased use of bioplastics. Product developers experience a lack of perceived behavioral control and struggle with doubts about the environmental benefits and incurring trade-offs of bioplastics with respect to the Triple Bottom Line. While product developers are intrinsically motivated to make more use of bioplastics, they often refrain from bringing products to the mass market due to uncertainties of customer receptiveness and fears of greenwashing allegations. Implications for industry and research are detailed.

Abstract: The Sustainable Product and/or Service Development (SPSD) approach is a pragmatic industry support encompassing a range of strategies aimed at maximising environmental and social performance in all types of “offerings” whether they are “products”, “services” or Product Service Systems (PSS). Implementation of the approach was tested in industry and conclusions reached on the effectiveness of the strategies included in terms of developing an offering with improved sustainability performance as well as practical use as an industry approach. Two strategies incorporated are functional and systems thinking, as these are seen as key for increasing the environmental benefits of offerings. This paper summarises the SPSD approach, general industry testing results, describes how and why functional and systems strategies are incorporated in it and industry testing results relating to their use. This provides valuable information on how functional and systems related considerations can be practically and effectively included in sustainable offering development.

Abstract: Abstract
A functional product is an integrated package consisting of hardware, software and a service support system that provides a customer with a certain function and is sold under a performance-based contract that includes a functional availability guarantee. For the availability performance, prediction, optimisation and management of risk are therefore important concerns during product development. This paper describes a software tool that can generate an integrated model of a functional product from its design details and analyse it through simulation to provide availability performance information. The model’s application to the analysis of a real industrial system is demonstrated. Such tools are important for the development and widespread adoption of functional products. The resulting analysis gave an indication of a suitable guaranteed functional availability level for the product and could be used to compare the performance of different design options.

Abstract: Abstract
This research examines the complementary effect of transaction cost perspective and resource-based view on multinational enterprises' (MNEs) ownership strategies. Advantages may be location bounded, making certain advantages transferable and others non-transferable. Drawing on the concept of transferability of advantage, this study examines the advantage's location-boundedness and the effect of transaction cost on MNEs' ownership strategy. The empirical analysis combines survey data and secondary data from annual reports. The use of multiple sources avoids common method biases. Regression results show that both transaction cost perspective and location-boundedness of advantage greatly affect international ownership strategy. This study contributes to the literature by further examining this effect, thus allowing a better understanding of a firm's advantage. Firms can apply the findings to design an ownership strategy that considers both efficient and benefit lenses, fostering successful foreign investment.

Abstract: Abstract
Downloading mobile applications (apps) becomes an indispensable part of smartphone users' life. In turn, users' apps evaluation is crucial for app service providers. This study develops a conceptual framework to outline users' behavior regarding apps that draws on signaling theory and regulatory focus theory. The study conducts two experiments involving 476 participants to test the research hypotheses. The results suggest that app type and perceived risk moderate reputation source's influence on users' attitude toward using apps. Message framing moderates the effect of app type on perceived usefulness of the app. This research advances signaling theory and message framing in explaining users' adoption and evaluation of mobile apps.

Abstract: Abstract
Over the last decade, educators, administrators, and policy makers increasingly focus on corporate social responsibility. However, no studies examine the relationships among corporate social responsibility, brand equity, and firm performance. This study uses quantile regression and structural equation modeling to explore the causal linkages among these factors in Taiwanese high-tech companies over the period 2010–2013.

The results of quantile regression analysis show that the economic dimension of corporate social responsibility and the prestige driver of brand equity are positive and significant for all the quantiles. The brand extension driver provides a significant positive effect at the higher quantiles of firm performance. However, the findings indicate a significant negative effect on firm performance for the brand loyalty driver. The findings of structural equation modeling suggest that corporate social responsibility and brand equity positively affect firm performance. This study provides useful insights on brand equity and corporate social responsibility.

Abstract: Abstract
Sales forecasting consists of calculating the expected sales of a specific product or company. An important issue when dealing with sales forecasting is the calculation of the average sales, usually using the arithmetic mean or the weighted average. This study introduces new methods for calculating the average sales. These methods are two modern aggregation operators: the ordered weighted average, and the unified aggregation operator. The main advantage of this approach is the possibility to deal with uncertain and complex environments in a more complete way. The study develops some key examples through multi-person and multi-criteria techniques. The study also presents a numerical example regarding the calculation of the average sales of a product in a set of countries.

Abstract: Abstract
This study examines factors that explain the creation of university spin-offs. The study focuses on mechanisms that technology transfer offices (TTOs) and universities employ to foster spin-offs. These mechanisms include technology transfer activities that support spin-offs, normative frameworks, support infrastructures (i.e., business incubators and science parks), and TTO staff's specialist technical skills. The analysis also differentiates between public and private universities. Spin-offs belong to one or more of the following groups: spin-offs with support from the university's TTO, spin-offs operating under a license agreement, and spin-offs in which the TTO or university holds equity. Qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) of 2011 data from 63 Spanish universities (46 public and 17 private) identifies recipes of antecedent conditions that effectively foster spin-offs. Results show that no unique combination of antecedent conditions yields more university spin-offs than any other does. This finding indicates that several strategies can successfully lead to academic entrepreneurship.

Abstract: Abstract
This study applies structural equation modeling (SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) method to data from social network media (SNM) users’ surveys to identify possible SNM viral effects on consumers’ purchase intention. SEM assesses the relationship between the criteria; fsQCA assesses the cause-and-effect process. Data from 36 valid variables validate the research model. This research surveys SNM users who use at least three major SNM platforms (i.e. Facebook, Instagram, and Youtube). Combination of Theory Reasoned Action (TRA), Information Adaption Model (IAM), perceived risk, and social interaction as additional external constructs shows source credibility and social influence critically affect attitude and subjective norms, which lead to purchase intention. SEM results show that social integration has no direct effect on subjective norms. However, fsQCA results show that social influence together with perceived risk in SNM sites affects consumers’ purchase intention.

Abstract: Abstract
Startups receiving assistance from business incubators (BIs) to decrease the high failure rate become a well-known phenomenon. In a review of the literature on BIs, papers seldom discuss BIs service capabilities in providing tenants with the correct assistance in overcoming post-entrepreneurial phase difficulties. For this reason, this study adopts an exploratory research method, semi-structured interviews and a statistical research method to analyze BI service capabilities. Most companies believe that the projects service category is more important than the resources service category for tenant long-term business development. BIs must provide office facilities and basic consultant services and also exert more effort in providing advanced services to tenants. This projects service category includes cooperating with tenants to create business plans, executive strategies and organizational institutionalization. This study provides specific suggestions for BI top managers, potential BI tenants and governments.

Abstract: Abstract
Right from the beginning of servitization research, one of the depicted organizational challenges of this transformational process resided in the realm of culture, especially concerning an organizational culture that is bound to a dominant product culture that prohibits the transformation to an integrated PSS provider. Therefore, the underlying concept of culture within current servitization studies promotes predominantly cultural consistence and coherence, possible variability's, ambiguities and paradoxes are to a greater extent omitted. Analysing and questioning the underlying concepts of culture within servitization research to this point, this paper will shed light on the question, how a comprehensive understanding of organizational culturecan offer further insights to support theservitization process of companies. Two concepts of culture that are linked to path research serve as a theoretical foundation: The first concept identifies organizational culture as a promoter of path dependence and therefore as an inhibiting factor within the servitization process. The role of agents is perceived rather passive within this view. The second concept of organizational culture stresses the role of culture as a promoter of path creation and therefore as an enabling factor within the servitization process. According to this view, social agents can actively use cultural means to create new paths for the organization. On this basis aconceptual framework for analysing organizational culture within servitization will be introduced that comprises the dimensions a.) path constitution, b.) role of agents and c) manifestations of culture. This framework embraces the ambiguity of culture within the transformation process as both, an inhibiting factor, as a culture that needs to be changed,and as an enabling factor, as a culture of change.

Abstract: Product-service system is a business model, in which a company offers a mix of products and services to maintain competitive edge, satisfy customer needs, and produce lower environmental impact than that produced by a traditional business model. This paper studies the modeling and optimization problems for a basic product-service system from the view point of operation management. The proposed system, modeled as a block structure Markov chain, features additional service capacity and impatient customers. The Matrix geometric methodology is applied to obtain the stationary distribution of the system. The performance indices for the system are derived based on the distribution, and the sensitivity of the performance with respect to the parameters is considered by numerical experiments. Meanwhile, the decision process of obtaining the optimal sets of additional service capacity opening threshold and the base store level is discussed from the point of view of profit optimization We propose algorithms to solve the problem, which are shown to be effective and efficiency by numerical experiments. The studies of the sensitivity of the optimal decision to the parameters propose some insight on system demand management and system improvement.

Abstract: The product–service system (PSS) is a system in which its integrated products and services jointly fulfill customer needs. The current research proposes a structured tool called the PSS Board to visualize the PSS process. This is a matrix board where the customer activities, state of the products, services, dedicated infrastructures, and partners are placed in rows, and the general PSS process steps are placed in columns. The visualized PSS on the board shows how the PSS provider and its partners aid customers' job execution process. Previous PSS cases are visualized based on the proposed PSS Board; the utility of the PSS Board is also identified. The current research can serve as an effective basis to analyze PSS from the perspective of fulfilling customer needs, thus supporting companies in diagnosing and elaborating their respective PSSs.

Abstract: Abstract
Servicizing has been identified as a business strategy that may contribute to the improvement of the environmental performance of economic activities. This paper analyses the organisational and environmental effects of servicizing in the farming sector. In particular, a case study of three Galician dairy farms which become members of cooperatives that provide them with farm machinery, heifer breeding and feeding services is carried out.

The paper begins by building upon existing theoretical literature concerning servicizing and its contribution to sustainability. Then, the Compound Method Based on Financial Accounts (MC3) is used to assess the changes in the carbon footprint (CF) of the farms included in the study both before and after their integration into cooperatives.

By means of servicizing the farms are released from the burden of having to make certain major investments and from having to undertake several specialised activities; in consequence they have more time and more resources to devote to their focal activity. In addition to products, the farms receive high quality services that help them to improve their efficiency and competitiveness. The paper shows a positive association between the shift to servicizing and the farms' improvement of eco-efficiency. In particular, the carbon footprint measured in relation to the number of litres of raw milk produced by each farm decreases in all three cases (within the range 16%–28%) for the period 2002–2011.

Abstract: Product-service system (PSS) approach has emerged as a competitive strategy to impel manufacturers to offer a set of product and services as a whole. A three-domain PSS conceptual design framework based on quality function deployment (QFD) is proposed in this research. QFD is a widely used design tool considering customer requirements (CRs). Since both product and services influence satisfaction of customer, they should be designed simultaneously. Identification of the critical parameters in these domains plays an important role. Engineering characteristics (ECs) in the functional domain include product-related ECs (P-ECs) and service-related ECs (S-ECs). ECs are identified by translating customer requirements (CRs) in the customer domain. Rating ECs’ importance has a great impact on achieving an optimal PSS planning. The rating problem should consider not only the requirements of customer, but also the requirements of manufacturer. From the requirements of customer, the analytic network process (ANP) approach is integrated in QFD to determine the initial importance weights of ECs considering the complex dependency relationships between and within CRs, P-ECs and S-ECs. In order to deal with the vagueness, uncertainty and diversity in decision-making, the fuzzy set theory and group decision-making technique are used in the super-matrix approach of ANP. From the requirements of manufacturer, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is applied to adjust the initial weights of ECs taking into account business competition and implementation difficulty. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed integrated approach for prioritizing ECs in PSS conceptual design.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper describes a computing model of a product-service-value system (PSV-S), especially its performance and behavioral models. We have developed PSV-S concepts as an abstraction of engineering solutions and processes. In this paper, we develop a model of a practical PSV-S with an emphasis on value creation for itself as well as for four other sources. This requires exchanges among five currencies. We then model a PSV-S internal structure recursively, containing four internal PSV-Ss, and six internal currencies. Initial models for external sources are based on supply-demand curves. At the end, this paper discusses the application of the computing model for virtual prototyping of PSV-Ss.

Abstract: Reaching a sustainable approach in industrial development is a complex challenge that involves several knowledge spheres. The lack of a common vision about sustainability complicates this research issue. The paper proposes a tool that faces with this obstacle during the first phases of design by means of a new instrument: the SUSTAINability map. It is based on two key items of TRIZ: the existence of Laws describing the Evolution of Engineering Systems and the System Operator. In order to clarify the logic of the proposed approach, that has been structured such that no TRIZ background is needed, the paper includes the presentation of a case study, in the field of clothes cleaning.

Abstract: Abstract
Innovative Product Service Systems are needed in order to keep the healthcare system affordable, while safeguarding or enhancing care quality. Local and European stakeholders are collaborating to address this challenge. As part of such a collaboration, this case study examined application of the Community-based Co-design approach to assistive technology development for informal care. A sequence of methods was applied, involving end-users and communities in the earliest design stages. A design target was found together with informal caregivers, and a solution was iteratively developed together with various stakeholders. This solution enables the informal caregiver both to monitor the care recipient while being away, and to efficiently manage emergency situations if these occur. The solution arranges existing technology in a unique and contextually appropriate way. This makes the solution much more likely to be accepted by end-users and their neighborhood communities. Community-based co-design was essential in reaching this result.

Abstract: Abstract
Although the notion of product-service system (PSS) has been highlighted to design a promising and practical products or services, researchers have little interests on the validation of operation models in successfully delivering the services to customers. In particular, the success of a service model can be difficult to be decided because the judgment of service providers and customers are inevitably considered. Thus, this paper aims at developing a simulation tool based on fuzzy classification, which can evaluate the performance of service models in a carsharing system. The fuzzy classification is applied to derive a service model that provides the highest income for service providers and the best service for customers. For this, this paper devises 36 service models that combine various options of carsharing service by considering relocation techniques and trip types (for example, one-way or roundtrip). In addition, a simulation algorithm is run to analyze the performance of various carsharing service models. Finally, the performance of all models is compared by three criteria (average profit per day, car utilization ratio and reservation acceptance ratio) for the aforementioned service models. A case of carsharing service in Seoul is investigated to illustrate the proposed simulation tool. This approach is expected to provide a useful tool for carsharing managers who are in charge of prioritizing the best service model before implementing the service in a realistic situation.

Abstract: Abstract
Several studies in Germany aimed at the development of a sound database on existing waste prevention measures by public bodies at the local, regional and federal levels. These results are the starting point for the creation of a national prevention program, which has to be presented by all European Member States until the end of 2013 — due to the revised European Waste Framework Directive.

Based on this empirical foundation, this paper draws conclusions with regard to drivers and barriers for eco-innovations in the field of waste prevention. The analysis shows that an optimized adaptation of information on waste prevention to the needs of specific target groups is still missing but could be a relevant driver. With regard to barriers the results of the study show that waste prevention is by no means always a win–win-situation. Institutional frameworks are missing to coordinate the different interests and for the exchange of experiences that could help to realize learning effects regarding innovation approaches.

Abstract: Abstract
The business model of high-value capital assets is shifting from purchasing a physical product to acquiring a result or a function supported by the product combined with a number of related services. One such service, maintenance, is perhaps the most efficient way to keep the function available during the product lifecycle. Automation has played a vital role in industry throughout history, particularly within the production line. With the movement towards providing product service systems the need for services such as maintenance are increasingly important for a manufactured product, and the pull towards automation may drive down costs and improve performance time. Although currently robotic applications to maintenance beyond monitoring and inspection tasks are not common, this research aims at exploring the feasibility of future maintenance robots that can perform a variety of maintenance tasks. As its first step, this work looks first at investigation, cataloging and classification of a number of maintenance tasks using standard industrial engineering techniques such as time motion, method or workflow analysis. This involves decomposing the maintenance work into a number of ‘unit tasks’ required to be performed in order to accomplish the specified maintenance.

Abstract: Abstract
This study suggests that in the entrepreneurial communities of emerging industries, individual entrepreneurs may simultaneously create opportunities that spill over to others and discover opportunities already created by others. Extant opportunity literature, focused on single actors and their personal networks or on the information function of market prices, is largely mute on the role of opportunities in value networks with distributed entrepreneurial efforts. Ecosystem theory, a literature stream that seldom intersects opportunity literature, contributes with a conceptual framework to study the question. The paper seeks to shed light on how opportunities are created or discovered by new ventures as they are involved in the interlinked endeavor of forming a new ecosystem.

The study examines five case studies of US ventures in the early phase of the solar service industry, an industry in which entrepreneurs offer customers access to solar panels as a service rather than as a product. These ventures inadvertently created an industry ecosystem together, as they could not protect the value created by their business partners׳ new knowledge, or by the emerging social webs between partners. They shaped opportunities together, passing value back and forth amongst themselves. This paper offers fundamental observations on how opportunity creation and discovery is distributed among a community of entrepreneurs as a business ecosystem grows.

Abstract: Abstract
Many manufacturers today are striving to provide high value-added product–service offerings (PSO) to their customers. PSO has heterogonous structure and various requirements, which may lead to technical attributes’ conflicts during the design process. The conflicts will lead to the difficulty of concept generation, increase of service delivery failure, and eventually the decrease of customer satisfaction. However, the conflicts in PSO design areas are more intangible and harder to formulate. Moreover, those conflicts are often resolved with trial and error methods in ad hoc processes, which largely depend on the designer’s intuition. Thus, in this paper, the authors propose a systematic method to identify PSO design conflicts and resolve them. The proposed method is based on the approach of service function and attributes analysis, group decision making with unbalanced linguistic label set and TRIZ methodology. In addition, a case study of design conflict identification and resolution for elevator service reveals the feasibility and potentials of the proposed method.

Abstract: Abstract
The purpose of this article is to advance empirical sustainability-evaluations of carsharing-systems. Carsharing, a frequently cited example of a product–service system (PSS), is currently morphing from a niche into a mainstream mode of transportation. Carsharing has the potential to provide a more sustainable mobility-option compared to private car usage, for example by reducing the overall motor-vehicle traffic in cities. However, the quantification of this potential is complex, and few studies have analyzed the fundamental impacts of the chosen measurement-methodology on the results of empirical carsharing-evaluations. This article analyses the time- and method-interdependencies of carsharing-studies based on a generic model structuring the adaptation of the mobility-behavior of carsharing-users over time. A paradigm shift from a static to a dynamic view on impacts of the PSS carsharing is proposed, which could support policymakers enacting carsharing-regulations in cities. The analysis of generic methodological interdependencies when conceptualizing impacts as dynamic processes is generalizable to impact-assessments of new technologies changing user-behavior over time.

Abstract: The product–service system (PSS) concept has been proposed as a way of dealing with unsustainable patterns of consumption in the business-to-consumer (B2C) domain. Existing alternatives to traditional consumption based on ownership, such as car sharing, communal washing centres and tool sharing schemes, indicate that more sustainable patterns of consumption may be found for other household functions. However, the low profile of these examples in society and on the market calls for a query into factors that may facilitate or hinder broader acceptance of more sustainable alternatives. In this study, the aforementioned examples are analysed from institutional and product–service system perspectives, and it is suggested that the embodiment of alternative consumption patterns into every day routines depends on institutional arrangements (regulatory and normative), on how the product–service systems are designed and applied in practice, and on the socio-cultural background of the society the systems are implemented in.

Abstract: The environmental problems associated with office furniture consumption call for a more efficient use of office furniture that can decrease emissions and volume of waste. The author discusses the opportunities and barriers for the implementation of a PSS for office furniture. In addition, the paper identifies possibilities to overcome these barriers. The article is based on interviews with European office furniture producers, customers and experts that were confronted with a PSS scenario that was developed based on literature. The author concludes that the practical implementation of the developed PSS scenario will probably not lead to much success under the current market conditions and suggests how the PSS scenario can be adjusted to offer environmental benefits and to provide alternative business models to producers.

Abstract: Abstract
Innovation is a key source of knowledge-based competitive advantage. However, research on how firms' co-production enhances innovation is scarce. Thus, this study not only integrates the three dimensions of social capital and examines these dimensions' separate effects on co-production but also incorporates the roles of absorptive capacity and self-efficacy, analyzing their effect on innovation. This study uses a random sampling method to select 221 firms in Taiwan and employs structural equations modeling to test the relationships. The findings indicate that absorptive capacity and self-efficacy enhance innovation. Co-production positively affects innovation, absorptive capacity, and self-efficacy. The findings also support positive relationships between social capital and co-production. This study contributes to the little research that explores partnership co-production in innovation.

Abstract: Eco-efficient Product-Service System (PSS) innovations represent a promising approach to sustainability. However the adoption of such business strategies is still very limited because it often involves significant corporate, cultural and regulatory barriers. An important challenge is not only to conceive eco-efficient PSS concepts, but also to understand the contextual conditions that facilitate their societal embedding, and which strategies and development pathways are the most appropriate.

The combination of theoretical insights from innovation studies (in particular Strategic Niche Management and Transition Management) and a case studies research (exploring the innovation journeys made by six companies in introducing their eco-efficient PSS innovations in the market) is used to investigate the factors that influence the implementation and diffusion of this kind of innovations. The article provides a structured overview of these factors, grouping them in four clusters: implementation of socio-technical experiments; establishment of a broad network of actors; building up of a shared project vision; creation of room for broad and reflexive learning processes.

Based on these results it is argued that a broader and more strategic system approach should be adopted by companies. Companies should focus not only on the PSS solution and its value chain, but also on the contextual conditions that may favour or hinder the societal embedding of the PSS itself. The article concludes by outlining a key area for future research.

Abstract: Abstract
Product development of today is becoming increasingly knowledge intensive. Specifically, design teams face considerable challenges in making effective use of increasing amounts of information. In order to support product information retrieval and reuse, one approach is to use case-based reasoning (CBR) in which problems are solved “by using or adapting solutions to old problems.” In CBR, a case includes both a representation of the problem and a solution to that problem. Case-based reasoning uses similarity measures to identify cases which are more relevant to the problem to be solved. However, most non-numeric similarity measures are based on syntactic grounds, which often fail to produce good matches when confronted with the meaning associated to the words they compare. To overcome this limitation, ontologies can be used to produce similarity measures that are based on semantics. This paper presents an ontology-based approach that can determine the similarity between two classes using feature-based similarity measures that replace features with attributes. The proposed approach is evaluated against other existing similarities. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is illustrated with a case study on product–service–system design problems.

Abstract: Abstract
In this study we propose a quality assessment framework for healthcare services. The proposed assessment framework is patient centric as it is based on patient expectations and perceived quality of service through their personal experience with the healthcare provider, across the various touchpoints during patient care. The framework generates a quality score which is a measure of the degree to which the patient's expectations were met or exceeded. We model the patient's perceived experiential value as a combination of extrinsic and intrinsic values. The extrinsic value includes the functional or utilitarian value, and to some extent, the social value. The intrinsic value includes emotional, epistemic and intrinsic social value. Using this generic framework for healthcare providers, and using a computerized system, appropriate instruments, rubrics or metrics can be designed for specific types of healthcare services. We show how this framework can be utilized for creating an assessment instrument for a specific healthcare facility in Korea – the Childhood Asthma Atopy Center in a general hospital located in Korea.

Abstract: Abstract
Major societal changes which challenge societal functions and actors' activities are needed to enhance sustainable development. Thus sustainable transitions research emphasizes co-evolutionary approaches involving a multitude of actors including the business sector, the government, and academia. Academic research can catalyse sustainable transitions by critically analyse current societal trends to develop and disseminate new knowledge. At research conferences, researchers and practitioners meet to network and discuss recent research findings providing arenas for testing and evaluating ideas to enhance sustainable transitions. This however requires some modifications of the standard design of a research conference.

Here we report learning outcomes from experimenting at the 18th international Greening of Industry Network conference during 21–24 October 2012 in Linköping, Sweden. The conference was a combination of a traditional conference structure with different interactive elements such as sustainability jam-sessions to discuss future challenges of six companies and clusters of companies at their site. The intention of doing so was to enhance learning outcomes both for visiting conference delegates and among actors in the host region. This was perceived by the participants as an innovative approach fostering both problem solving and creation of new ideas. Four out of the six companies continued dialogues about sustainable production fields or bio-refineries with Linköping University.

In addition we introduce and summarize research findings presented at the conference which were further developed into research articles. The essence of these articles covers sustainable industry management; cleaner production; industrial ecology; cooperation between industry, governments and academics; dissemination of concepts and technologies; methods and tools for modelling and measuring of industrial symbiosis, CO2 performance and eco-efficiency.

Abstract: Abstract
The concept of circular economy (CE) is to an increasing extent treated as a solution to series of challenges such as waste generation, resource scarcity and sustaining economic benefits. However the concept of circularity is not of novel as such. Specific circumstances and motivations have stimulated ideas relevant to circularity in the past through activities such as reuse, remanufacturing or recycling. Main objectives of this work are: to provide a comprehensive review of research efforts encompassing aspects of resources scarcity, waste generation and economic advantages; to explore the CE landscape in the context of these three aspects especially when they are considered simultaneously; based on an idea of a comprehensive CE framework, propose an implementation strategy using top-down and bottom-up approach in a concurrent manner. To fulfill this objective a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art research is carried out to understand different ideas relevant to CE, motivation for the research and context of their recurrence. Main contributions of this paper are a comprehensive CE framework and a practical implementation strategy for a regenerative economy and natural environment. The framework emphasizes on a combined view of three main aspects i.e. environment, resources and economic benefits. It also underlines that joint support of all stakeholders is necessary in order to successfully implement the CE concept at large scale. The proposed framework and implementation strategy also identify new avenues for future research and practice in the field of CE.

Abstract: Abstract
Studies on the adoption of sustainable consumption patterns have shown that citizen participation in the development of new products, services and systems, such as eco-towns, can, among other things, increase the legitimization, market acceptance and sustainability impact. Cooperatives that traditionally act on behalf of and work very closely with their members may be particularly well-suited to leading participatory development processes. By exploring the cooperative-led development of a new sustainable neighborhood in Switzerland, we analyze how citizens participated in different phases of the development process and the extent to which cooperative characteristics influenced this participation. We find empirical evidence that cooperatives and cooperative networks are a promising organizational form for involving citizens in all phases of the development process of new sustainable neighborhoods. Our findings add new insights to the literature of sustainability transitions by highlighting the cooperative network as a powerful actor for promoting participation in sustainable urban development, inducing learning processes beyond the boundaries of the newly developed neighborhood.

Abstract: Abstract
Process development is key to competitiveness in process industries. However, budget overruns frequently plague process development projects which span organizational boundaries to involve both buyers and suppliers. We identify uncertainty and equivocality as key antecedents causing such negative effects, and investigate the reduction and performance implications of these two variables. An empirical survey of 52 joint process development projects show that project teams reduce uncertainty through early end-user involvement, whereas equivocality can be reduced by joint problem-solving activities among buyers and suppliers.

Abstract: Abstract
In this study we focus on how e-retailers who deal with innovative products in the era of the Internet of Things (IoT) select product delivery service providers to ensure timely and efficient delivery to customers. Based on the asset–process–performance framework, we propose a triadic model that includes e-retailers, product delivery service providers and customers to achieve synergy and customer satisfaction in the era of the IoT. We find that substantive selective criteria should include consideration of product delivery service providers’ hard and soft infrastructure. In addition, flexibility is a key criterion that will strengthen the relationship between e-retailers and product delivery service providers to improve the competitiveness of e-retailers as well as to satisfy the customers. We validate the model using data from 148 Taobao e-retailers. Our results indicate that both hard and soft infrastructures have positive influence on flexibility which in turn has a positive impact on customer satisfaction. Indeed, flexibility fully mediates the relationship between hard and soft infrastructures and customer satisfaction. Our theoretical triadic model is one of the first attempts in providing product delivery service providers selection criteria for e-retailers selling innovative products and its influence on customer satisfaction. Our findings provide guidelines for both e-retailers and product delivery service providers to improve their competitiveness.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturers and service providers are called to design, plan and operate globalized manufacturing networks, addressing to challenges such as ever-decreasing lifecycles and increased product complexity. These factors, caused primarily by mass customisation and demand volatility, generate a number of issues related to the design and planning of manufacturing systems and networks, which are not holistically tackled in industrial and academic practices. The mapping of production performance requirements to process and production planning requires automated closed-loop control systems, which current systems fail to deliver. Technology-based business approaches are an enabler for increased enterprise performance. Towards that end, the issues discussed in this paper focus on challenges in the design and planning of manufacturing networks in a mass customization and personalization landscape. The development of methods and tools for supporting the dynamic configuration and optimal routing of manufacturing networks and facilities under cost, time, complexity and environmental constraints to support product-service personalization are promoted.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing institutions are increasingly adopting and implementing a servitization strategy directed at enhancing their revenue streams and gaining a competitive advantage in a highly competitive and extremely turbulent marketplace. The focus of this paper is directed at gaining an understanding of (1) the various interactive systems that assume relevance in the creation and execution of the servitization strategy and (2) the development of a generic servitization systems framework. A multidisciplinary literature review was undertaken in order to identify the systems concerned and develop a generic servitization framework that could serve as a source of reference and information in strategy development and operational execution. Supporting evidence as to the relevancy of the model was obtained from a case study analysis conducted at a South African manufacturing institution that had implemented a servitization strategy. An important finding that emerged from the research study was that the institution's business model needed to be adapted, a process that necessitated an understanding of the respective systems involved, their interaction, and the change management difficulties encountered therein. The generic servitization framework was found to assume relevance in this regard. It is contended that the servitisation systems framework could serve as a source of reference and information for executives, management practitioners and technologists involved in similar projects.

Abstract: Abstract
Most of manufacturing enterprises design their products through the 3D CAD system. Generated 3D CAD data are mainly used in design and manufacturing stage for product engineering. Since the 3D CAD data includes not only shape models but also part structures and specifications, it is possible to reuse the data in various kinds of manufacturing-related activities after design and manufacturing. For example, 3D CAD data could be used to produce a catalog for marketing and promotion of products by replacing product images, a manual provided to the customers by implementing the animation for the operation of the product and educational materials for training of service staffs by guiding maintenance instructions interactively. These activities for customer support are necessary and significant from the perspective of product lifecycle although they may be not directly related to productivity and quality of products. However, a lot of manufacturing enterprises, especially SMEs (small and medium-sized Enterprises) have difficulty in to carry out these activities due to problems of cost and labor. In this context, this study proposes a new service model to support the manufacturing-related activities to be able to use 3D CAD data. The service model could operate through a software system as follows: A service provider (e.g. IT service vendor) makes core functions to process and manipulate 3D model a form of service platform and develops applications based on the service platform according to the supporting activities so that more applications could be added and expanded effectively. A service consumer (e.g. manufacturing enterprise) requests a service with required data such as 3D CAD data and service contents data to the provider and receives deliverables corresponding to the service. To implement the service model, this study specifies stakeholders, workflow and data of the service model, and develops the service platform. And this study illustrates an industrial case of the service model by developing a 3D digital catalog application and demonstrating a home appliance example.

Abstract: Abstract
The general marketing literature suggests that brand personality, satisfaction, and customer identification with the brand are important drivers of consumer behavior in several contexts. Yet, the literature lacks studies on these constructs' role in tourist behavior. In an endeavor to overcome this research deficit, this study explores the interrelationships among destination personality, tourist satisfaction, and tourist–destination identification, and the extent to which they are important in influencing positive word-of-mouth and revisit intentions. The study employs structural equation modeling to analyze data from 490 Taiwanese consumers reporting on their most recently visited tourism destinations. Findings indicate that (1) destination personality promotes tourist satisfaction, tourist–destination identification, positive word-of-mouth, and revisit intentions; (2) satisfaction encourages identification and word-of-mouth; and (3) identification enhances word-of-mouth and revisit intentions. The paper provides theoretical and managerial implications.

Abstract: Abstract
Product-Service Systems (PSSs) constitute a family of service-based business models designed to satisfy our societal needs in an economically and environmentally sustainable manner. To date however PSS application has remained niche due to a variety of critical barriers. This paper explores how ‘demand pull’ national government policies could support PSS activity by addressing these barriers and cultivating market demand. Lessons are drawn from a case study of how regulatory, economic incentive, informative and procurement policies have supported Energy Service Company (ESCo) activity in the UK; a sub-set of the PSS family focused on energy service provision. Subsequently five policy recommendations are presented to support PSS activity: (1) balancing economic incentives and regulatory disincentives; (2) promoting indirect policy support; (3) redesigning existing market structures; (4) promoting locally-led PSS activity; and (5) creating stable policy frameworks. The paper warns however that national government policy cannot easily address all PSS barriers, such as customer preferences, international developments, technological progress and inherent business model weaknesses, pointing to the need for other complementary solutions. Furthermore, other governance actors beside national government could also implement PSS supporting policies.

Abstract: The purpose of this paper is the discussion of the environmental effects of a free-floating car-sharing system operating in Ulm, Germany. The system, called car2go, allows users to take and leave vehicles at any point within the city limits. Thus opposed to traditional car-sharing, there are no fixed stations and in particular one-way trips of any length are possible without a booking requirement. Since this is the first free-floating system in operation, there is as yet no associated empirical research. Based on primary data from a survey, a model was developed to forecast the environmental impact of car2go. The prognosis considers the period of five years after the launch of car2go in 2009 and indicates a CO2-reduction per average car2go-user. In addition, more than a quarter of the survey respondents stated that they may forgo a car purchase if car2go was offered permanently. By reaching a greater share of citizens than traditional systems, the results indicate that free-floating car-sharing systems could contribute to reducing private vehicle ownership in cities.

Abstract: Technical services such as maintenance, retrofitting, refurbishing or user training can significantly influence the economic and ecologic performance of high quality investment goods, thus providing new and advanced user benefits. In order to systematically exploit these potentials the interrelations between physical products and non-physical services need to be considered proactively, resulting in the necessity for integrating corresponding product and service design processes. For this reason, a process for the systematic design of product related technical services is introduced that upon its modularization represents a promising starting point for linkage with corresponding product design processes. Life cycle oriented design of technical Product-Service Systems is thus supported. The presented concept is finally illustrated by means of an example from the investment goods industry.

Abstract: Abstract
The aim of this paper is to investigate potential benefits and challenges regarding knowledge transfer and cultural change from the provider and buyer perspectives when using IPSOs for Swedish rail infrastructure. Considering material use and the importance of availability of the tracks makes rail infrastructure an interesting candidate for a business model based on a life-cycle approach, which can result in a reduction in cost and environmental impact.

The concept of the Integrated Product Service Offering (IPSO) has in several business areas proven to be a means with potential to reduce the environmental impact of products and services, increase cost efficiency and quality, and act as a driver for change. The business model, which is based on a life-cycle approach, focuses on the function instead of the initial price of the product.

Among the main findings are the lack of information and knowledge transfer that act as a barrier for innovation, and that the buyer's conservative business culture makes it difficult to implement new types of contracts. Since IPSO contracts require improved information transfer, they could potentially stimulate innovation as well as processes for evaluation of the contracts. By involving the contractors in the design phase their knowledge could be used in a better way, creating a feedback loop from practice to design.

The empirical part, focusing on the rail infrastructure industry in Sweden, has been collected using individual interviews and a group interview approach.

Abstract: Abstract
The circular economy (CE) aims to radically improve resource efficiency by eliminating the concept of waste and leading to a shift away from the linear take-make-waste model. In a CE, resources are flowing in a circular manner either in a biocycle (biomass) or technocycle (inorganic materials). While early studies indicate that 3D printing (3DP) holds substantial promise for sustainability and the creation of a CE, there is no guarantee that it will do so. There is great uncertainty regarding whether the current trajectory of 3DP adoption is creating more circular material flows or if it is leading to an alternative scenario in which less eco-efficient localised production, demands for customised goods, and a higher rate of product obsolescence combine to bring about increased resource consumption. It is critical that CE principles are embedded into the new manufacturing system before the adoption of 3DP reaches a critical inflection point in which negative practices become entrenched. This paper, authored by both academic and industry experts, proposes a research agenda to determine enablers and barriers for 3DP to achieve a CE. We explore the two following overarching questions to discover what specific issues they entail: (1) How can a more distributed manufacturing system based on 3DP create a circular economy of closed-loop material flows? (2) What are the barriers to a circular 3D printing economy? We specifically examine six areas—design, supply chains, information flows, entrepreneurship, business models and education—with the aim of formulating a research agenda to enable 3DP to reach its full potential for a CE.

Abstract: Chemical use reduction is strongly desirable for environmental and public welfare reasons, and is a critical element of moving towards more sustainable consumption in the business-to-business economy. However, the fundamental economic relationship between chemical supplier and chemical customer creates supply side incentives for increased chemical use. Chemical management services (CMS) is a business model that aligns economic incentives in the chemical supplier–customer relationship towards reduced chemical use by making chemical services rather than chemical volume the basis of supplier compensation. CMS thus ‘servicizes’ the chemical supply chain and is a Product Service System with significant potential environmental benefits. CMS enjoys high penetration in the US auto and semiconductor sectors, and is emergent in other sectors. The paper synthesizes lessons learned from hands-on work with 15 chemical-using firms over 5 years in all aspects of CMS program implementation. Key points are that poor cost accounting and chemical information management form significant barriers to making, understanding and evaluating the CMS business case. The details of contractual compensation mechanisms are critical to achieving in practice the potential environmental benefits of the CMS model.

Abstract: This paper describes an applied research work that looks at different ways to effectively manage resources. Particularly, it describes how revenue management techniques can be used to balance demand against capacity, and describes a system that uses different OR and AI techniques to intelligently price diverse products and services. This system can produce pricing policies for wide range of products and services regardless of the model of demand used. The system incorporates a model specification layer, which provides flexibility in defining the demand model for different products. It also incorporates an optimisation layer, which takes the specified model as an input and produces the pricing and production guidelines for the product. The system can be either used as a stand alone system or can be incorporated as a generic modelling and optimisation component within a larger revenue management system.

Abstract: Abstract
Transformative change of energy systems towards distributed renewable technologies requires not only technological but also organisational innovation in order to engage broad segments of the private consumer market. Using the business model concept as an analytical tool, this comparative study investigates organisational configurations related to the deployment of customer-sited photovoltaic (PV) systems in Germany, Japan and the United States. Results show how the deployment of customer-sited PV systems in these three countries has been enabled and catalysed through distinctively different business models. Specifically, solar firms have managed to overcome various barriers to the adoption of PV in distinct ways. Furthermore, we identify a number of contextual conditions that have shaped the design and mode of operation of the respective business models in the three countries. The study provides novel insights for both policy makers and solar firms that wish to develop alternative governance models and new business strategies, respectively. Such insights are important to support the accelerated diffusion of distributed PV systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Regression is a common method to calculate relationships between variables. Quantile regression extends the calculation to the coefficients of various quantiles, providing a more complete overview. In addition, quantile forecasting models forecast coefficients. This study proposes a new algorithm to calculate the quantile confidence intervals of the in-sample data to forecast the coefficients of the out-of-sample data. The algorithm analyzes ICT data for 78 countries between 1999 and 2010. Results show that the algorithm provides valid forecasting results and outperforms previous studies. These quantile confidence intervals can also forecast the independent variables' impact trends on the dependent variable. The algorithm is applicable to different domains.

Abstract: AbstractPurpose
This study aims to investigate how customer co-creation affects the performance of service innovation through the operant resources.
Design/methodology/approach
This study uses survey methodology to examine a research model with six hypotheses. Data from 149 high-tech firms are analyzed using structural equation modeling.
Findings
The dialogic co-creation affects customer relationship strength (relational resource), valuation of knowledge (informational resource), and capability of customization (organizational resource), facilitating service innovation.
Research limitations/implications
Findings offer novel insights into how service innovation co-creation takes place within a dialogic context leading to organizational changes. The results clarify the influences of operant resources on service innovation and indicate that companies should emphasize dialogic communication with customer in developing service innovation.
Practical implications
Managers have to understand that co-creation is an effective approach in business to stretch business boundaries, and that customers are the crucial external party that co-creates. According to the mutual influences of co-creation, businesses not only can exploit knowledge from customers but also strengthen the relationship bond with them. For the investment programs on service innovation of businesses, managers should allocate budget to relation-specific investments and knowledge acquisition with customers.
Originality/value
This research model, guided by the R-A theory and S-D logic, might serve as a template for scholars exploring issues of service innovation. Findings of this study identify important implications that benefit service innovation research in several ways.

Abstract: Abstract
As global competition intensifies, many national research institutes (NRIs) are investing substantial resources in research and development (R&amp;D) to gain competitive advantage and develop the national economy. However, R&amp;D investment involves a high degree of market and technological uncertainty. The literature on project portfolio selection focuses on either quantitative economic benefits or complex criteria to assess project(s). By emphasizing the features of NRIs, the present study proposes a decision model for evaluating a project portfolio at the early initiation stage. This decision model rests on a strategy for differentiating products and services. The decision model provides a solution to a market need to maximize benefits through differentiation. A systematic hybrid multiple-criteria decision-making (MCDM) method comprising a modified Delphi method (MDM), a decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) method, and an analytic network process (ANP) offers a systematic approach to the project portfolio-selection problem. The present empirical study on the selection of alternative R&amp;D projects in NRIs investigates the flexible electronics industry, using the hybrid MCDM method to test the decision model's effectiveness. The present study also discusses cognitive differences between NRIs and for-profit organization in terms of their R&amp;D portfolio selection.

Abstract: The product service systems’ (PSS) sustainability potential is described in the framework of the new types of stakeholder relationships and/or partnerships, producing new convergence of economic interests, and a potential concomitant systemic resources optimization.

In this perspective, it is argued that the design competencies should move towards those of the ‘strategic design’, thus introducing the concept of ‘strategic design for sustainability’: the design of an innovation strategy, shifting the business focus from designing (and selling) physical products only, to designing (and selling) a system of products and services which are jointly capable of fulfilling specific client demands, while re-orienting current unsustainable trends in production and consumption practices.

Some examples of PSS are presented and discussed using the PSS categories ‘services providing added value to the product life cycle’, ‘services providing final results to customers’, and ‘services providing enabling platforms for customers’. The cases derive from an analysis of the ‘environmental friendly innovation’ yearly endowed prize submissions. The Politecnico di Milano University together with the Bocconi University and Legambiente (an environmental NGO) promotes the initiative in Italy.

Abstract: Abstract
Forests are the most important resource of our planet. The usefulness of forests is spread from commercial exploitation of them for timber and other products to maintenance of wildlife, ecological balance, prevention of soil erosion, etc. In achieving these goals the essential factor is the proper forest management. Forest management is a system of actions for supplying different products and services for society. In developed countries forest management tends to be elaborated and planned in order to achieve the objectives that are considered desirable for environment and economy. Forests are the most biologically diverse land ecosystems that can supply different products and services. The working of this system is influenced by the natural environment, climate, topography, soil, etc., and also by human action. Forests have been and are managed to obtain the traditional forest products: fire wood, fiber for paper, building timber etc. with little thinking for other products and services. Nevertheless, as a result from the development of ecology science and environmental awareness, management of forests for multiple use is becoming more common. Public concern regarding forest management have shifted from the extraction of timber for earning money for the economy, to the preservation of additional forest resources, including wildlife, soil and water conservation, recreation etc. Forests are the repositories of aesthetic, ethical cultural and religious values.

Abstract: Product-service system (PSS) design focuses on customer value and satisfaction more than traditional product or service design, and pays much attention to making improvement strategies due to the immaturity of engineering design methodology. Customer satisfaction evaluation attracts PSS providers’ attentions in supporting PSS design. Importance–performance analysis (IPA) as an effective customer satisfaction evaluation tool is revised and used to identify PSS improvement strategies in this paper. The new IPA is proposed for three reasons. First, considering the fact that the attribute performance and importance are not independent variables and attribute performance has a nonlinear relationship with the overall satisfaction, Kano’s model is integrated into IPA. Second, to overcome the drawbacks of statistic method and artificial neural network (ANN) in obtaining attribute importance implicitly, e.g. requiring sufficient and confident data, and overlooking the attribute original importance about attribute’s contributing level to customer value realization, a set of adjustment models are proposed to revise the attributes original importance according to the Kano quality categories of attributes and the levels of attributes performance. Third, considering the mutual influence relationships among attributes, the proposed IPA takes these relationships into account by decision making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL). In addition, to deal with the uncertainty and vagueness in evaluation process, vague sets are employed in the revised IPA. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed customer satisfaction evaluation approach.

Abstract: Abstract
Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodological framework that estimates environmental impacts of products, systems or services in a life cycle perspective (from cradle to grave) at local to global levels. Some environmental impacts can vary depending on the characteristics of their surroundings, and therefore on the location of the activity. This variability can be taken into account in environmental assessment using spatialized LCA. Spatial differentiation is especially relevant when studying territories (ca. 100–10,000 km2), which often have high heterogeneity in environmental characteristics. In this study, we developed a method for spatialized territorial LCA (STLCA) that combines spatialized LCA and territorial LCA to study land-use planning in an agricultural territory. An agricultural territory is defined as a geographically delimited area in which the majority of land use or economic activity is based on agriculture. STLCA can estimate potential environmental impacts of an agricultural territory for land-planning purposes, such as which agricultural activities should be developed and where to locate them. The method consists of six steps: (1) defining boundaries and functions of the territory under study and identifying the human activities to include, (2) defining and locating activity and environment typologies within the territory, (3) determining the spatialized life cycle inventory by locating emissions using regional data, if possible, (4) determining spatialized life cycle impact assessment for all regional impacts considered, (5) mapping impacts inside and outside the territory, and finally (6) analyzing results using sensitivity and uncertainty analysis. Objectives of this method are to (1) give more accurate results than a territorial LCA without spatial differentiation, (2) help decrease environmental impacts within a territory while avoiding transfer of impacts to other territories and (3) help avoid or minimize impacts of exchanges of resources or products with other territories.

Abstract: Equivocality, or divergent interpretations and understandings of tasks and knowledge, has negative effects on performance because it increases conflicts and creates communication and coordination challenges in inter-organizational innovation projects. However, equivocality may also stimulate team members to discuss beliefs and interpretations in ways that provide improved understanding of knowledge and tasks. We theorize that mitigation of negative effects of equivocality on project performance is conditional on explorative or exploitative knowledge search mode. Exploitative search (increasing search depth) allows for rapid learning based on the partners’ existing knowledge, but it also limits a team’s ability to interpret and combine diverse knowledge. Explorative search (increasing search breadth), on the other hand, allows for novel combinations of diverse knowledge and thereby alleviates the negative effect of equivocality on performance. Based on quantitative data from 251 respondents in 52 heavy-engineering innovation projects in four multinational corporations based in Sweden and from their 29 collaborating partner firms worldwide, we find that equivocality reduces project performance, but that joint explorative search mitigates the negative effect of equivocality on project performance. However, we do not find support for the moderation effect of exploitative search on the relationship between equivocality and project performance. Theoretical and managerial contributions as well as limitations and suggestions for future research are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
The demographic change situation in Germany, as well as in other leading industrial nations, leads to an overload of the family and institutionalized nursing care system structure. For this reason, novel solutions must be developed, in order to guarantee fully independent living of the elderly people, and an efficient assistance or nursing, in diverse living environments. The research project LISA has investigated the possibilities to embed mechatronic, assistive functions and services into compact wall “terminal” elements thereby enabling autonomous and independent living upon performing Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) by means of generated structured environments and robotic micro-rooms (RmRs). In this article, a classification of the approach in the broader context of research, as well as a statement of methodical and structured multi-phase development are described. The conceptual and development phases and the technical details using selected assistive functions of the entire system are presented. The article explains the methodical approach throughout the four phases of development and focuses on essential field trials with collected user feedback.

Abstract: Sustainable development requires radical and systemic innovations. Such innovations can be more effectively created and studied when building on the concept of business models. This concept provides firms with a holistic framework to envision and implement sustainable innovations. For researchers, the concept provides an analytical tool that allows them to assess the interplay between the different aspects that firms combine to create ecological, economic, and social value. In addition, the business model concept provides a link between the individual firm and the larger production and consumption system in which it operates. This paper provides an introduction to the special issue, which emerged from selected papers presented at the ERSCP-EMSU 2010 Conference held in Delft, The Netherlands. Papers in the special issue cover a broad range, from a conceptual discussion resulting in a research agenda, the assessment of diffusion of specific business models such as Product-Service Systems, the introduction of new management tools for business transition management, to case studies on how specific business models evolved in specific communities. Together, these papers provide insight into the promise of the business model concept for understanding and advancing sustainable innovation.

Abstract: Abstract
A study performed in summer 2008 has shown that manufacturing firms are more and more inclined to associate services around the product they deliver. Offers are proposed but not generalized as manufacturers encounter obstacles. The main one comes from the separation that exists between products and services which lead to define specific management tools and methods. Today, the economical context leads manufacturing firms to consider priorities managed by service providers and external elements coming from the customers. Moreover, manufacturers are obliged to consider products and services deliveries as a mixed activity. To respond to these problematics, we propose to use enterprise modeling methods to define the bases of a reference model of a mixed enterprise able to propose products and product services paying attention to specific management functions to ensure customer satisfaction.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
The chemical industry products are supplied to almost all kinds of activities. Any change in the composition of substances, aiming less aggression to the environment, may cause changes on the behavior of the almost entire production chain, and this result will be perceived by reducing the environmental impact. This is one of the main reasons leading industries of this sector to engage activities aimed at the sustainability of their operations, particularly in regard to the social and environmental issues. In this context, the study identifies how companies of the chemical industry manage innovation practices oriented towards sustainability. To develop the study were analyzed industries installed in Brazil, recognized by the adoption of innovation practices and committed to sustainable development. The data of this study were obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with the main representatives of the R&amp;D areas for the four companies analyzed, and supplemented by secondary data published in the companies’ sustainability reports and their respective websites. The conceptual model used was adapted from Hansen, Grosse-Dunker and Reichwald (2009), which presuppose that the management of sustainable innovation occurs through the incorporation of five dimensions of analysis: integration of the sustainability criteria, integration stakeholders and users, expansion of the product-service system; marketing of the innovation aimed at the sustainability and awareness of the sustainability context. The analysis of data obtained reveled that companies keep investments in eco-efficient manufacturing, integrating the sustainability criteria in the development of processes and products adding value to products and processes. The management of partnerships with stakeholders for technology creation, investments in products with socioecological appeal and the consciousness by the leaders on the importance of sustainability in the company’s operations and products are also part of main results. However, it is noted that a strategy exploited by only a few companies focus on the inclusion of a sustainable management as an expansion of product-service system that could bring in new kinds of relationships between stakeholders and partners, adding value to the product.

Abstract: Product–service system (PSS) planning has been attracting attentions of global manufacturers to change from providing only products to offering both products and their services as a whole. The PSS planning approach can maintain the functionality of products for customers throughout the whole product life-cycle. Identification of the product and service parameters in early design stages plays a critical role in PSS development. The PSS planning is usually started by the mapping from customer requirements (CRs) in the customer domain to engineering characteristics (ECs), including product-related ECs (P-ECs) and service-related ECs (S-ECs), in the functional domain. In this paper, a systematic decision-making approach for PSS planning is developed to determine the optimal fulfillment levels of ECs considering requirements of customers and manufacturers. The PSS planning is conducted through four phases. First, the initial weights of ECs considering customer needs are achieved based on fuzzy pairwise comparison. Second, the data envelopment analysis (DEA) approach is applied to obtain the final weights of ECs considering customer requirements as well as other requirements of the manufacturers. Third, the ECs are categorized into different Kano attribute classes using fuzzy Kano’s questionnaire (FKQ) and fuzzy Kano’s mode (FKM) for evaluation of the PSS. In the last phase, non-linear programming is carried out to maximize the fulfillment levels of ECs. A case study is carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed optimal PSS planning approach.

Abstract: There has been an increase in the relevance of and interest in services and services research. There is a acknowledgement that the emerging field of services science will need to draw on multiple disciplines and practices. There is a growing body of work from Human–Computer Interaction (HCI) researchers and practitioners that consider services, but there has been limited interaction between service researchers and HCI. We argue that HCI can provide two major elements of interest to service science: (1) the user centred mindset and techniques; and (2) concepts and frameworks applicable to understanding the nature of services. This second option is of major concern in this paper, where we consider Long’s work (undertaken with John Dowell) on a Conception for HCI. The conception stands as an important antecedent to our own work on a framework that: (a) relates the various strands of servicer research; and (b) can be used to provide high-level integrative models of service systems. Core concepts of the UCL Conception such as domain, task, and structures and behaviours partially help to relate systematically different streams of services research, and provide richer descriptions of them. However, if the UCL Conception is moved towards services additional issues and challenges arise. For example, the kinds of domain changes that are made in services differ; services exist in a wider environment; and that effectiveness judgements are dependent on values. We explore these issues and provide reflections on the status of HCI and Service Science.

Abstract: Robot based incremental sheet metal forming, also called Roboforming, is a dieless incremental forming process. It is especially suitable for rapid prototyping and manufacture of small batch sizes with low costs. This paper introduces the whole process Chain of this method, including CAD, CAM and CAE. With the use of this process chain, not only the robot programs for forming experiments, but also the simulation results of formed workpieces can be obtained. Furthermore, the CAE-results are used in the CAM-process to realize the tool path planning considering both CAD-models and many real influencing factors on the forming accuracy.

Abstract: Abstract
In this paper we introduce a method that combines principal component analysis, correlation analysis, K-means clustering and self organizing maps for the quantitative semantic analysis of textual data focusing on the relationship between firms’ co-creation activities, the perception of their innovation and the articulation of the attributes of their product-enabled services. Principal component analysis was used to identify the components of firms’ value co-creation activities and service value attributes; correlation analysis was used to examine the relationship between the degree of involvement in specific co-creation activities, the online articulation of firms’ service value attributes and the perception of their innovativeness. K-means and self organizing map (SOM) are used to cluster firms with regards to their involvement in co-creation and new service development, and, additionally, as complementary tools for studying the relationship between co-creation and new service development.

The results show that, first, there is a statistically significant relationship between firms’ degree of involvement in co-creation activities and the degree of articulation of their service value attributes; second, the relationship should be considered within the context of firms’ innovation activities; third, OS Software-driven firms are the best example in terms of co-creation and new product-enabled service development, i.e. the collaborative principles built in their customer participation platforms should be adopted by other (non-software) firms interested in enhancing their innovation capacity through involvement in co-creation and new product-enabled service development.

Abstract: Abstract
This article summarizes the results of an empirical study focusing on the value of product-enabled services in intensive R&amp;D spenders. The focus is on product-driven firms for which new service development is expected to be particularly promising but also quite challenging. Part of the motivation is based on the fact that existing studies on the value attributes of hybrid offerings are mostly conceptual and need to be further substantiated through more systematic empirical studies. The research includes two samples with a total of 83 product-driven firms selected among the top R&amp;D spenders in Canada and Europe. It adopts an innovative methodology based on online textual data that could be implemented in advanced business intelligence tools aiming at the facilitation of innovation, marketing and business decision making. Combinations of keywords referring to different aspects of service value were designed and used in a web search resulting in the frequency of their use on companies’ websites. Principal component analysis was applied to identify distinctive groups of keyword combinations that were interpreted in terms of specific service value attributes. Finally, the firms were classified by means of K-means cluster analysis in order to identify the firms with a high degree of articulation of their service value attributes. This work articulates a relatively simple and intuitive method for quantitative and qualitative semantic analysis of online textual data that is similar to latent semantic analysis but could be used as part of more user-friendly expert system solutions and business intelligence tools based on easily accessible business statistics packages. The results show that the main service value attributes of the Canadian firms are: better service effectiveness, higher market share, higher service quality, and customer satisfaction. The service value attributes for the European firms include, among others, product added-value, product modernization and optimization of customer time and efforts. Canadian firms focus on collaboration and co-creation with suppliers and customers for the sake of product–service innovation as a competitive advantage on the marketplace. On the other hand, the focus of EU firms on innovative hybrid offerings is not explicitly related to business differentiation and competitiveness.

Abstract: Abstract
The main drivers for the development and evolution of Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are the reduction of development costs and time along with the enhancement of the designed products. The aim of this survey paper is to provide an overview of different types of system and the associated transition process from mechatronics to CPS and cloud-based (IoT) systems. It will further consider the requirement that methodologies for CPS-design should be part of a multi-disciplinary development process within which designers should focus not only on the separate physical and computational components, but also on their integration and interaction. Challenges related to CPS-design are therefore considered in the paper from the perspectives of the physical processes, computation and integration respectively. Illustrative case studies are selected from different system levels starting with the description of the overlaying concept of Cyber Physical Production Systems (CPPSs). The analysis and evaluation of the specific properties of a sub-system using a condition monitoring system, important for the maintenance purposes, is then given for a wind turbine.

Abstract: Abstract
Firms using third-party-ownership (TPO) business models transform solar rooftop installations into a simple service. TPO firms sign long-term agreements with building owners or users to install, finance and manage locally sited solar panels. Customers simply buy solar electricity. The business model can increase total PV market demand by removing central barriers to PV adoption including technology risk, financing needs, and learning costs. TPO is now the dominant US model for residential solar and attempts to use the business model are underway in Europe and Asia.

This study discusses how policy makers can enable emergence of solar TPO business models in new markets, a theme novel to extant literature. The paper is based on a comprehensive study of the US solar TPO ecosystem including 50 interviews with key market actors.

A downside to the TPO model is potential lock-out of innovative solar technology. Crucial policy actions to enable TPO emergence in new markets are to ensure the legality of the TPO model and to facilitate solar self-consumption (the ability of customers to offset grid electricity costs by using locally generated solar electricity).

Abstract: In this paper we will provide full algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions for the controllability/reachability/null controllability of a class of bimodal discrete-time piecewise linear systems including several instances of interest that are not covered by existing works which focus primarily on the planar case. In particular, the class is characterized by a continuous right-hand side, a scalar input and a transfer function from the control input to the switching variable with at most two zeroes whereas the state can be of any dimension. To prove the main result, we will make use of geometric control theory for linear systems and a novel result on controllability for input-constrained linear systems with non-convex constraint sets.

Abstract: Abstract
Policy makers and environmental agencies have echoed concerns brought forward by academics about the need to address the rebound effect for achieving absolute energy and environmental decoupling. However, such concerns have generally not been translated into tangible policy action. The reasons behind this inaction are not fully understood, and much remains unknown about the status of the rebound effect issue on the policy agenda and policy pathways available. Such knowledge gaps may hamper the development of effective policies to address this issue. In this paper, we examine the extent to and ways in which the rebound effect is considered in policy documents and analyse thirteen specific policy pathways for rebound mitigation. The effectiveness of the pathways is scrutinised and conclusions are offered to mitigate rebound effects. The main policy conclusions of the paper are that an appropriate policy design and policy mix are key to avoiding undesired outcomes, such as the creation of additional rebound effects and environmental trade-offs. From the discussion, economy-wide cap-and-trade systems as well as energy and carbon taxes, when designed appropriately, emerge as the most effective policies in setting a ceiling for emissions and addressing energy use across the economy.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite rising prices for natural resources during the past 30 years, global consumption of natural resources is still growing. This leads to ecological, economical and social problems. So far, however, limited effort has been made to decrease the natural resource use of goods and services. While resource efficiency is already on the political agenda (EU and national resource strategies), there are still substantial knowledge gaps on the effectiveness of resource efficiency improvement strategies in different fields. In this context and within the project “Material Efficiency and Resource Conservation”, the natural resource use of 22 technologies, products and strategies was calculated and their resource efficiency potential analysed.

In a preliminary literature- and expert-based identification process, over 250 technologies, strategies, and products, which are regarded as resource efficient, were identified. Out of these, 22 subjects with high resource efficiency potential were selected. They cover a wide range of relevant technologies, products and strategies, such as energy supply and storage, Green IT, transportation, foodstuffs, agricultural engineering, design strategies, lightweight construction, as well as the concept “Using Instead of Owning”. To assess the life-cycle-wide resource use of the selected subjects, the material footprint has been applied as a reliable indicator. In addition, sustainability criteria on a qualitative basis were considered.

The results presented in this paper show significant resource efficiency potential for many technologies, products and strategies.

Abstract: Abstract
For quantitative in vitro–in vivo extrapolation (QIVIVE) of metabolism for the purposes of toxicokinetics prediction, a precise and robust analytical technique for identifying and measuring a chemical and its metabolites is an absolute prerequisite. Currently, high-resolution mass spectrometry (HR-MS) is a tool of choice for a majority of organic relatively lipophilic molecules, linked with a LC separation tool and simultaneous UV-detection. However, additional techniques such as gas chromatography, radiometric measurements and NMR, are required to cover the whole spectrum of chemical structures. To accumulate enough reliable and robust data for the validation of QIVIVE, there are some partially opposing needs: Detailed delineation of the in vitro test system to produce a reliable toxicokinetic measure for a studied chemical, and a throughput capacity of the in vitro set-up and the analytical tool as high as possible. We discuss current analytical challenges for the identification and quantification of chemicals and their metabolites, both stable and reactive, focusing especially on LC–MS techniques, but simultaneously attempting to pinpoint factors associated with sample preparation, testing conditions and strengths and weaknesses of a particular technique available for a particular task.

Abstract: Abstract
With the increasing application of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) products and services, knowledge of the Total Electron Content (TEC) variation is vital, particularly in historically under-sampled regions. The ionospheric induced-error, which is the largest and most variable error source of GNSS applications, is proportional to TEC along the satellite-receiver path. Simultaneous Global Positioning System (GPS) measurements from six African equatorial and low latitude stations in the southern hemisphere are used to investigate the latitudinal variation of TEC over the region during the year 2013, a year of moderate solar activity. The analysis reveals some detailed features of seasonal, month-to-month and solar activity dependence of TEC. The seasonal variation of TEC revealed that the daytime and the pre-midnight values of TEC for stations located close to the geographic equator is considerably higher in equinoxes and June solstice compared to stations farther from the equator, however, the difference is insignificant during the December solstice. The month-to-month variation of TEC shows semi-annual symmetry/asymmetry in TEC values for stations closer/farther from the equator. TEC sensitivity to solar activity shows significant seasonal and latitudinal characteristics. Generally, a relatively good correlation exists between TEC and F10.7 for stations around the Equatorial Ionization Anomaly (EIA) region compared to those found at stations close to the equator. Beyond the EIA region, the correlation coefficients drop in all seasons. TEC predicted by the three topside options of the International Reference Ionosphere (IRI) 2012 model [i.e. the NeQuick (NeQ), IRI-2001 Corrected (IRI-01 Corr) and the IRI-2001 (IRI-01) options] exhibits latitudinal and seasonal characteristics. The NeQ option performed better than the other two options at stations located within the equatorial region in most of the months and seasons. Outside the EIA region, the IRI-01 Corr and IRI-01 options give better predictions. Generally, the three model options give improved TEC representations with increasing latitude.

Abstract: Abstract
The transformation of product-centric businesses towards service provision is claimed to be a viable strategy for manufacturers across industries and sectors. However, previous research on servitization has not paid sufficient attention to explicitly investigating its suitability for manufacturers operating in different organizational environments. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to establish propositions on the contingency factors in the organizational environment that affect the servitization of manufacturers at the industry level. Drawing on the theory of organisational ecology, the propositions include the effects of population density, competing populations, resource dependency, institutional linkages, technology, and political forces. Our study suggests that the operating environment explains at least part of the difficulties in the servitization process, which have been identified in previous studies, but whose causes have remained without full explanation. The study adds to the current understanding of the contingencies of transformation toward service provision and contributes to the managerial decision-making processes related to servitization.

Abstract: With the development of mass customization (MC) paradigm, service product/package configuration is getting crucial to service industry. Aiming to extend the achievements of product configuration in manufacturing industry to service industry and considering ontology’s reusability, an ontology-based service product modeling approach for configuration is presented in this paper. Firstly, service variants of service products are represented through the feature modeling approach. Then, the feature-based service model is formalized in OWL (Ontology Web language) – an ontology language for semantic web, and configuration rules are formalized in SWRL (Semantic Web Rule Language) – a rule language. Configuration reasoning processes are performed with the support of JESS (Java Expert System Shell) rule engine. Finally, the proposed approach to service customization is demonstrated by an example of configuring service packages for China Mobile.

Abstract: Abstract
Holonic and Service-Oriented Architectures have been proposed as solutions for the conception of flexible and reactive systems. The combination of both architectures has been recognized as an attractive solution for the conception of more flexible and reactive systems. Services, originally conceived for web applications, need new models that better adapt to the needs of manufacturing systems namely, the specification and planning of processes. This paper proposes a methodology for designing customizable product-process specifications based on manufacturing-services that are suitable for product driven applications. A framework is proposed for modeling manufacturing-services designed for its application in Holonic Manufacturing Systems, preserving the fractal character found in products and processes. Three types of manufacturing processes are identified based on the relations among its composing operations and a model is proposed for each type. Application service-ontologies are created to describe operations and resource capabilities rather than complex semantic descriptions to facilitate process design and reduce the computational load of service discovery for planning. The framework leverages service reusability among process families in the same way as physical features are reused among product families. An illustrative example describes the design of a product's process specification based on the manufacturing service framework in a Holonic Manufacturing System, giving rise to Service-oriented Holonic Manufacturing Systems.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents an Intentional Architectural Framework for developing Knowledge-Intensive Service System Architectures (IAF-KISSA). This framework enables the specification and evaluation of knowledge-intensive service systems (KISS) architectures at the levels of network, performance, engagement, and activities. A chosen architecture then allows designing, developing, and adapting a KISS throughout its lifecycle. This research is motivated by the lack of service systems engineering (SSE) methods specifically created for KISS, despite their economic importance in industrialized economies. Examples of KISS include joint innovation initiatives and IT outsourcing contracts. KISS possess a number of distinctive characteristics, including: the knowledge-intensity of their processes and outputs; the inter-organizational coproduction of outputs, and the multi-stakeholder perspective that drives the evaluation of these systems’ performance. SSE aims to define and discover dynamic relationships among entities in order to plan, design, and adapt services systems to cocreate value [1,2]. SSE calls for a change in perspective in service engineering, from services as products to services as socio-technical systems where actors and resources are configured to collaboratively create value. An important challenge for the field of SSE is the creation of advanced models, methods, and tools for developing service system architectures. However, current service system architectures typically retain a functional and provider perspective on service systems operations without accounting for KISS characteristics. Using an intentional approach leads to modeling a service system in terms of agents, goals, strategies, and dependencies, thus addressing these concerns by moving from a functional to a strategic level of analysis [4]. Using an intentional approach to architecting KISS is thus ideally suited to their social and behavioral complexity. IAF-KISSA contributes a novel approach for architecting KISS, a type of service system that has hitherto been beyond the scope of SSE. Moreover, given the importance of knowledge for all types of service systems [2], IAF-KISSA could provide an innovative manner in which to architect service systems in general.

Abstract: This paper underlines and debates the importance of developing specific guidelines and checklist per product typology, as tools to make eco-efficient design become a reality.

The argumentation is accompanied by the description of a project commissioned by the NECTA Vending Solutions (the European leader of drinks &amp; food vending machines) to the DIS research unit (Design and Innovation for environmental Sustainability, Politecnico di Milano University – The DIS research unit of Politecnico di Milano University is offering, since 10 years, applied researches and company consulting on Life Cycle Design and eco-efficiency improvement. Typical consulting activities are: Life Cycle Assessment; handbook for LCD and eco-efficient product, service and product-service system development; procedure and tools to integrate environmental requirements into company existing product, service and product-service system development process; courses on LCD), resulting in such tools, currently integrated into the company product development process. The considerations are based upon on primary data and experiences.

The final results of this project are two handbooks of guidelines and checklists for the eco-efficient development of two types of vending machines: one for Snack &amp; Food (spirals model), the other for Hot &amp; Cold drinks.

In order to achieve these results an LCA has been developed and a system to prioritize guidelines has been adopted; this system has led to a procedure which moves from general to specific guidelines and checklist. Finally these tools have been integrated within the company procedure.

The method adopted by DIS in this applied research is described, highlighting the observed key success factors in a project between a University research unit and a company.

Final considerations expand upon the matured experiences to demonstrate the importance and efficacy to go from general methods and tools to more specific ones (e.g. specific guidelines and checklist), in order to implement Life Cycle Design principles, in the real company practices and culture.

Abstract: Abstract
Consumers are overwhelmed with products in retail and online environments. Research shows that this choice-overload often leads to consumer dissatisfaction. As a consequence, assistive consumer technologies are needed to support decision making. Taking the fashion industry as an example, a common approach is to offer online services or self-service terminals that allow consumers to filter the product range according to their preferences. Nevertheless, this option is only applicable when the consumer is aware of his/ her actual preferences. The inspiration phase is a neglected area of research that offers huge potential for the development of new services to support the consumers in the buying process. This paper introduces the concept and prototype of a novel consumer interface for intuitively browsing a fashion product range based on visual preferences. In addition to an online version of the service a terminal for usage in retail stores is presented. The key idea of the visual interface is to position a selected fashion product in the middle of the screen and similar products in the surrounding environment comparable to terms in a tag cloud. The outer area of the virtual presentation shows products with a higher degree of dissimilarity. By selecting one of them the visualization rearranges. In the solution presented, product similarity is mainly based on visual features (e.g., brightness, color temperature, color values) which are extracted from product images. Finally, the functional as well as the hedonic value of the new approach are evaluated by a preliminary user study.

Abstract: Product creation is facing the next level of fundamental changes. Global demands are growing substantially to achieve energy efficient and sustainable value creation networks for production, products and services without compromising traditional success factors such as time to market, cost and quality. To stay competitive within such an environment development partners in industry and public sectors will require new interplay solutions for engineering design execution, domain knowledge representation, expert competence utilization and digital assistance systems. This scenario offers the chance for virtual production creation solutions to become critical for the future by offering unique engineering capabilities, which have not yet been explored or deployed. The paper investigates key elements of modern Virtual Product Creation – such as agile process execution, functional product modeling and context appropriate information management – towards their competitive role in satisfying increasing numbers of product requirements, in delivering robust systems integration and in ensuring true sustainable product lifecycle solutions.

Abstract: Abstract
Advances in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), computing, networking, mechanics and electronics are changing the people’s way of life. Several research efforts are leading the design and development of Artifact and Service Combination (ASC) with the implementation of Ubiquitous Technologies (UTs) in multidisciplinary sectors. However, the design process of such systems often ends in the implementation of conventional approaches and tools. A Ubiquitous Design Support Environment (UDSE) comprising an application intended to guide the different activities, tools and resources applied at the conceptual design stage is presented. After needs analysis, multidisciplinary collaborations are also required in order to generate innovative conceptual solutions, focusing this approach in the conceptual design stage of traditional design methods. Some activities from the conceptual design stage are enhanced through the use of the UDSE as well as through the use of a novel ubiquity assessment tool for concept selection and validation of Ubiquitous Products and Services. Finally, a case study on a Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) from textile sector, in a developing country, is presented to analyze and validate the presented concepts.

Abstract: Abstract
As an effective policy which brings the service providers high occupancy rate and generates more profit than fixed pricing, the dynamic pricing strategy is extensively used in the online distribution channel. This paper studies the optimal dynamic pricing strategy based on market segmentation for service products in the online distribution channel taking hotel rooms as an example. Firstly, the pricing model is built to maximize the hotel profit through a dynamic process. Then the solution methodologies based on Chebyshev's Sum Inequality and dynamic programming are provided for the linear demand case and non-linear demand case, respectively. The optimal number of segments and optimal boundaries can be obtained. The results suggest that an appropriate policy of market segmentation in using of online reservation systems is benefit for the service suppliers as well as the consumers. Finally, an illustration based on a 300-room hotel is provided for the more realistic non-linear case.

Abstract: Abstract
The shortage and uneven spatial and temporal distribution of water resources has seriously restricted the sustainable development of regional society and economy. In this study, a metabolic theory for regional water resources was proposed by introducing the biological metabolism concept into the carrying capacity of regional water resources. In the organic metabolic process of water resources, the socio-economic system consumes water resources, while products, services and pollutants, etc. are output. Furthermore, an evaluation index system which takes into the characteristics of the regional water resources, the socio-economic system and the sustainable development principle was established based on the proposed theory. The theory was then applied to a case study to prove its availability. Further, suggestions aiming at improving the regional water carrying capacity were given on the basis of a comprehensive analysis of the current water resources situation.

Abstract: Abstract
Access to modern energy services represents a great challenge for about 1.4 billion people living in low and middle-income contexts. This paper discusses the combination of Distributed Renewable Energy (DRE) with Product-Service Systems (PSS) business models, an approach that is considered promising to deliver sustainable energy solutions in these contexts. This paper aims at filling the knowledge gap regarding the combination of these two models. In particular it puts forward a comprehensive classification able to encompass all the most important dimensions characterising PSS applied to DRE, and identifies 15 archetypal models of PSS applied to DRE. This new classification system and the related archetypal models have been tested and evaluated with companies and experts from Botswana and South Africa, showing their potential to be used as a strategic design tool to support innovation in this field.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturers undergoing servitization resort to an increased number of suppliers to deliver services. Although managing upstream relationships is particularly critical in servitized contexts, theory development on this topic is still at an early stage. This study analyses the linkages between the types of services that servitized manufacturers outsource and the relationships they establish with their suppliers.

First, we present a framework that is based on a multidimensional description of buyer–supplier relationships and on a categorisation of services. Second, we present the empirical findings coming from multiple case studies and discuss the characteristics of buyer-supplier relationships for Product support, Customer support and Process related services (the three categories investigated) in the light of the presented framework.

The paper contributes to the servitization literature by showing that there is no one best way to shape buyer–supplier relationships in servitized environments. Instead, the type of service being outsourced is one of the key factors that influence the way upstream relationship should be crafted.

Abstract: Abstract
Companies face challenges and need support when applying specific knowledge to their innovation processes, such as design for sustainability. The providers of innovation support in innovation systems are intermediaries. While the literature on intermediaries focuses on various roles and approaches, the way in which intermediaries function in specific fields such as design for sustainability remains underexplored. This paper investigates how intermediaries provide innovation support in the design for sustainability field today, with a focus on the services and support they offer, the approaches and drivers that shape them, as well as the challenges of the intermediation process, particularly concerning sustainability and design. To do this, 14 intermediaries from the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and Turkey were investigated through case studies. The role of design in support processes, especially during implementation, the importance and types of collaborations among various actors of innovation systems, and the emergence of a new type of intermediary that promises radical innovation in sustainability are among the findings. In addition, based on the empirical data, we suggest a framework for describing the roles and attributes of a group of five intermediaries that meets the needs of all types of companies engaged in design for sustainability. Finally we offer suggestions for Turkey on how to raise the capacity of its intermediaries operating in the design for sustainability field, which might be applicable to other similar contexts as well. This study contributes to the theory and practice of innovation support in the sustainability field, from which all innovation system's actors, especially intermediaries and governmental institutions, might benefit in designing support programs.

Abstract: Abstract
The efforts to address markets as socio-technical orders have hitherto focused on the role of marketing in shaping demand. However, in many markets the role of purchasing is just as important. This paper uses a case study to examine how a single buying company can attempt to shape an emerging market through its purchasing practices. As a result, the study identifies five types of market-shaping actions. Within each action type, the market-shaping behavior of a buyer in an emerging market can be very diverse and include internal actions as well as actions aimed at influencing other market actors. While agency on the purchasing side is often associated with large size organizations, namely government and public sector agencies, our case study shows that agencies on the purchasing sides can be deployed in a variety of ways rather than merely through raw bargaining power. The findings indicate that buying firms do not simply adjust their own purchasing processes according to existing offerings, but actively attempt to drive market evolution in particular directions.

Abstract: ‘Design for Remanufacture’ or DfRem, is an area of remanufacturing research that has received relatively high levels of interest in recent years, due to the recognition that a product’s design may have a high impact on remanufacturing efficiency. However, the overall volume of literature dedicated to DfRem is low and there is still much to learn about the subject. The purpose of this literature review is to collate the current body of literature and establish a contemporary understanding of DfRem through analysing the trends, agreements and conflicts of opinion in the field. Much of the DfRem literature to date is focused upon the investigation of remanufacturing problems associated with product design, and the subsequent development of design methods and tools, either specifically developed to aid DfRem or as adaptations of existing design methods. These methods and tools vary in purpose and intended use but all largely remain within the academic realm to date. Within the literature there is widespread agreement that any approach to DfRem must consider both product and process, yet the ‘design for X’ definition of the task continues to spark debate. The key problems and issues that future DfRem research should address have been identified in this paper, from both within the literature and from the current gaps in the literature. Some key recommendations for future research include the need for ‘lifecycle thinking’ within design method development and the need for greater exploration into the organisational factors affecting DfRem integration into the design process, from the perspectives of the OEM and designer.

Abstract: Abstract
The concept of smart specialization has attracted great interest and has been adopted widely in European regional and innovation policy. Foresight is an important part of creating smart specialization strategies. However, both the smart specialization concept and foresight have been criticized for lacking an empirical and theoretical foundation that can help guide their application in practice. This paper contributes to the theoretical foundation of smart specialization and regional foresight by drawing on the field of economic geography and elaborating a typology for patterns of smart specialization. We highlight that there are different paths to reaching smart specialization within the same industrial domain. The empirical research focuses on the offshore wind service sector in four regions around the North Sea. The findings corroborate a typology that offers four distinct patterns—diversification, transition, radical foundation, and modernization—all of which can enable the creation of new industrial activities where regions enter an emerging industry based on fundamentally different starting points.

Abstract: Green public procurement has emerged as a policy instrument with a significant potential to steer procurers' and producers' decisions in a sustainable direction. The purpose of this study is to assess the process for development of green public procurement criteria at a Swedish governmental expert body from a strategic sustainability perspective, i.e. to identify strengths and weaknesses from such a perspective as a basis for making this process more supportive of sustainable product and service innovation. A previously published framework for strategic sustainable development is used for the assessment. The assessment shows that the criteria development process is transparent, well-documented and that it encourages a high level of participation by the members of the working groups. However, the assessment also points to several weaknesses of the process. These include, e.g., a limited impact perspective and lack of a clear definition of sustainability objectives. The development process therefore results in criteria which mainly concern a selection of current environmental impacts outside the context of long-term objectives and consequently there are no strategies to prepare for future processes. The conclusion is that the current process may result in improvements as regards some known environmental problems, but to allow for a strategic approach that could more significantly promote innovative product-service system solutions in support of sustainable development, process changes are needed. Essential process changes are proposed in this paper.

Abstract: Maintenance schemes in manufacturing systems are devised to reset the machines functionality in an economical fashion and keep it within acceptable levels. The notion of periodic functional resetting to reduce complexity has been utilized in this research to introduce and formulate a novel metric to evaluate and quantify function resetting due to a given maintenance policy. The two main parameters are the rate and extent of function resetting. The developed periodicity metric can be used as a criterion for comparing different maintenance policy alternatives and as a tool for predicting system performance under a given maintenance policy. An industrial example is used to illustrate the application of the new metric. The proposed method and metric for assessing maintenance strategies in the functional domain are sufficiently general and can also be applied in other applications that involve system resetting.

Abstract: Although the anticipated rise of accountable care organizations brings certain potential threats to radiologists, including direct threats to revenue and indirect systemic changes jeopardizing the bargaining leverage of radiology groups, accountable care organizations, and other integrated health care delivery models may provide radiology with an important opportunity to reassert its leadership and assume a more central role within health care systems. Capitalizing on this potential opportunity, however, will require radiology groups to abandon the traditional “film reader” mentality and engage actively in the design and implementation of nontraditional systems service lines aimed at adding differentiated value to larger health care organizations. Important interlinked and mutually reinforcing components of systems service lines, derived from radiology's core competencies, may include utilization management and decision support, IT leadership, quality and safety assurance, and operational enhancements to meet organizational goals. Such systems-oriented service products, tailored to the needs of individual integrated care entities and supported by objective performance metrics, may provide market differentiation to shield radiology from commoditization and could become an important source of new nonclinical revenue.

Abstract: As hardening competition in industry pushes manufacturing companies to deliver increased customer value, communication with the customer during the use phase becomes paramount. This paper investigates whether warranty management could be a strategic tool for improved integrated product/service engineering (IPSE) as a firm moves from component to system solution supplier. The research methodology applied was a multiple case study, with four suppliers as focal firms, where buyer–supplier relationships were investigated from a supplier perspective. Results show that advanced warranty management, implemented as a strategic tool, can be a key to efficient IPSE.

Abstract: Abstract
While verification is an important and expensive task in the development of airborne systems, insights gained into the system under test are still very much treated in an isolated way. This means that the knowledge established in the testing of airborne systems in product development is currently not applied to e.g. repair or maintenance processes. This raises the question, whether the methods, tools and processes as well as the knowledge which is generated during testing are exploitable in the following life cycle phases, especially for service and maintenance processes? This paper presents a vision and investigates the potentials of how the methods, tools, processes and knowledge used during the verification phase in the beginning of life of an airborne system could be utilized in later lifecycle phases. A special emphasis is placed on how they can be applied to improve repair and maintenance activities in the context of NFF (No Failure or No Fault Found) cases (and vice versa). It can be expected that the methods, tools, processes and knowledge could be valuable for reducing ground times of aircraft, minimizing repair costs, reducing efforts for failure analysis considerably and improving aircraft safety.

Abstract: The point of departure for this article is the need for product-centric firms to compete in the market by adding services to their portfolio, which requires a greater focus on service innovation if they are to remain competitive. A major challenge associated with the shift from product-centeredness to a product-and-service orientation is the management of the essential dynamic capabilities of sensing, seizing, and reconfiguring needed for service innovation. The research study reported identifies key microfoundations forming the basis of successful realignment of a firm's dynamic capabilities so as to achieve a better fit with service innovation activities. Eight qualitative case studies of product-centric firms form the basis of the study. The findings make three primary contributions to the body of knowledge. First, they extend the existing literature on dynamic capabilities by specifically discussing microfoundations related to service innovation. Second, the study extends existing work on service innovation into the manufacturing industries by identifying the key microfoundations in that context. Third, the research provides empirical evidence of dynamic capabilities in practice, especially in product-centric settings in which the service context is novel.

Abstract: Services based around complex engineering equipment and systems provide substantial challenges in both the long-term management of the equipment and the need for guaranteed delivery of the related service. One of the challenges for an organisation providing these services is the management of the information that is required to design, deliver and subsequently assess the success of the service. To assist in this process this paper develops a model for capturing, organising and assessing information requirements for these Complex Engineering Services in which information required to support key decisions in the life cycle of the service is identified. The model – referred to as The 12-Box Model for Service Information Requirements – is embedded in a three-phase procedure for providing an assessment of information requirements of a service contract which also provides insight into the capabilities of available information systems in supporting the contract. An illustrative example examining service information in an aircraft availability contract is used to demonstrate the use of the 12-Box Model and associated assessment procedure.

Abstract: This paper evaluates if offering Electrical and Electronic Equipment (EEE) as a Product Service System (PSS) reduces material use and waste generation. Three hypothetical EEE lease/reuse and existing product systems in Japan were evaluated by using an indicator, annual product demand. The lease systems appeared to use more materials than the conventional reuse system. Lease systems can reach the same material intensity as conventional reuse systems, if: (1) the number of leased products is reduced, (2) the lifetime of leased products is extended to that of firstly owned products, and (3) the lease system increases the number of reused products in use. Whether a system shortens or extends the lifetime of products appeared to be the key factor to determining material intensity, not whether the system itself was a lease system or a possession system.

Abstract: Dürr is one of the world's leading suppliers of products, systems and services, mainly for automobile manufacturing. The range of products and services covers important stages of vehicle production. As a systems supplier, Dürr plans and builds complete paint shops and final assembly facilities. Industrial Solar – formerly known as Mirroxx – is the leading manufacturer of Fresnel process heat collectors and can look back on seven years operating experience with its systems.

Automotive industry is under considerable strain to make their products more environmentally sound. Not only the cars themselves, but also the whole value chain has to become more sustainable. One production process, which contributes a significant share to the carbon footprint of a car, is the curing of a car's paint. As the temperatures in the convection ovens are up to 200 °C the application of market available flatplate or vacuum tube collectors was not an option, as these collector types cannot provide such high temperatures. Also the thermal power needed for a convection oven is well above the typical power range of solar collectors, which were originally designed for domestic hot water applications.

A pilot system of a solar driven convection oven has been installed on the Dürr Campus in Bietigheim-Bissingen near Stuttgart/Germany. An Industrial Solar Fresnel collector consisting of six modules with a total aperture area of 132 m2 heats pressurized water to an outlet temperature of 180 °C. A fossil fired backup boiler complements the solar thermal system to meet the thermal power demand of the convection oven. Finally the heat is dissipated in the convection oven via a pressurized water – air heat exchanger.

Abstract: Manufacturing or service systems with multiple product classes, job circulation due to random failures, resources shared between product classes, and some portions of the manufacturing or assembly carried in series and the rest in parallel are commonly observed in real-life. The web server assembly is one such manufacturing system which exhibits the above characteristics. Predicting the performance measures of these manufacturing systems is not an easy task. The primary objective of this research was to propose analytical approximations to predict the flow times of the manufacturing systems, with the above characteristics, and evaluate its accuracy. The manufacturing system is represented as a network of queues. The parametric decomposition approach is used to develop analytical approximations for a system with arrival and service rates from a Markovian distribution. The results from the analytical approximations are compared to simulation models. In order to bridge the gap in error, correction terms were developed through regression modeling. The experimental study conducted indicates that the analytical approximations along with the correction terms can serve as a good estimate for the flow times of the manufacturing systems with the above characteristics.

Abstract: Terminology in the field of sustainable development is becoming increasingly important because the number of terms continues to increase along with the rapid increase in awareness of the importance of sustainability. Various definitions of terms are used by different authors and organizations, for example, green chemistry, cleaner production, pollution prevention, etc. The importance of this topic has stimulated research into the problems of clarifying ambiguity and classifying terms used in the sustainability field. This paper provides results of the literature survey and summarizes the definitions of the terms, focusing on the environmental engineering field. In some cases, it proposes an improved definition. A hierarchical classification of the terms and their relationships has been based on a layer format that is presented graphically.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents an integrated literature review on how the environmental sustainability of distributed production is studied in a variety of disciplinary sources. The notion of distributed production suggests an alternative to mass production that differs in scale, location and consumer–producer relationship. Understanding its environmental implications (and thereby dematerialization potential) is regarded pertinent and timely. Key themes in the review included how distributed production can promote product longevity and closed material loops, as well as localizing production. New and closer ties between producer and consumer seemed central discussions but were underdeveloped with regard to sustainability potential. Empirical work was seen especially in research on Additive Manufacturing Processes, while the bulk of the studies were conceptual explorations with little testing in the real world as yet. This affirms the emerging nature of the topic and points to a clear need for more (and more diverse) empirical research. The review summarizes the opportunities for greater environmental sustainability as well as potential threats that could serve to guide and improve these novel practices today. It sets the stage for ‘distributed production’ to be examined as its own phenomenon by proposing how it can be characterized and suggests that a research agenda could build upon the work initiated here.

Abstract: Long-term relationships between original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and stakeholders in their supply chain and end-of-life process can be designed, while considering uncertainty in future environmental legislation changes. This study proposes a method to analyze the capability of OEMs to reconfigure their supply chain and end-of-life operations to achieve performance targets, which are defined in terms of environmental impacts and life cycle costs. Using life cycle simulation (LCS), the physical deterioration and the functional obsolescence of individual products are considered as stochastic elements in the analysis. The analyzed reconfiguration capability provides the OEM with robustness against uncertainty from a life cycle perspective.

Abstract: Abstract
One of the key aspects of the approaching data-intensive science era is integration of data through interoperability of systems providing data products or visualization and processing services. Far from being simple, interoperability requires robust and scalable e-infrastructures capable of supporting it. In this work we present the case of EPOS, a plan for data integration in the field of Earth Sciences. We describe the design of its e-infrastructure and show its main characteristics. One of the main elements enabling the system to integrate data, data products and services is the metadata catalogue based on the CERIF metadata model. Such a model, modified to fit into the general e-infrastructure design, is part of a three-layer metadata architecture. CERIF guarantees a robust handling of metadata, which is in this case the key to the interoperability and to one of the feature of the EPOS system: the possibility of carrying on data intensive science orchestrating the distributed resources made available by EPOS data providers and stakeholders.

Abstract: Many environmental strategies relying on a mere improvement of resource productivity and eco-efficiency of processes and products are not able to fully address the environmental impacts induced by increasing consumption. In addition to these strategies, the concept of sustainable consumption calls for changing the levels and patterns of consumption, which require complimentary approaches. However, so far, there has been a noticeable lack of strategies that conceive ways of shifting from a material-intensive consumer culture to a society with less materialistic aspirations.

This paper aims to provide a critical overview of the current debate, research trends and main outcomes relating to the area of sustainable consumption. It is based on the study commissioned by the Swedish EPA and focuses on current research streams and activities of main stakeholders. It identifies and discusses the gaps in the existing range of initiatives and policy instruments towards sustainable consumption.

Abstract: This study explores whether disconfirmation theory can explain satisfaction formation processes in library users. Both library users' needs and expectations are investigated as disconfirmation standards. Overall library user satisfaction is predicted to be a function of two independent sources—satisfaction with the information product received and satisfaction with the information system and library services used to retrieve the information product. Both sources are hypothesized to contribute independently to satisfaction in library users.

Abstract: Abstract
The water footprint (WF) concept links physical and virtual forms of water, which can be used for research on the impact on water resources imposed by human consumption or production activities. Debates remain on the calculation methods due to WF being applied for different research purposes, and the large amounts of data required for the calculation being hard to obtain. This paper calculated and compared two WFs called volumetric WF (the volumes of blue and green water are combined with the same weight) and stress-weighted WF (the volumes of blue and green water are combined with different weights) based on water use data to research crop water productivity of grain crops and its impact on water resources in each region of China. Results for volumetric WF and stress-weighted WF of grain products of each region in China differed greatly. In 2010, the average volumetric WF was 1.25 m3/kg with the blue component 0.53 m3/kg, and the average stress-weighted WF was 0.51 m3/kg. In addition, there were significant differences of both kinds of WFs among regions in China. The results showed that volumetric WF could be used as a comprehensive indicator for evaluating crop water productivity, specified in space and time by source (green and blue WFs). Stress-weighted WF could offer a meaningful way of making quantitative comparisons between products, production systems and services in terms of their potential to contribute to water scarcity. The spatial distribution of these two WFs can help decision making to develop water-saving measures, relieve water stress and restore ecosystems for each region in China.

Abstract: This paper investigates the elements that can generate an increase in industrial green product sales in Brazil. Multiple case studies were performed with five suppliers of green products, as well as two distributors for each supplier. Each supplier identified the distributor with the highest sales performance and the distributor with the lowest sales performance (in geographical areas with similar sales potential). While the findings suggest that technical specifications are mandatory for attracting and retaining the best distributors of green products, they also suggest that technical specifications cannot assure sales. Suppliers must provide not only advertising and financial and technical support to the distributors but also stable sales commissions (a problem in the Brazilian green market). Accordingly, suppliers must consider both the profits and the losses of their distributors to increase sales, and the cost of such support may be higher than the costs incurred for non-green products. However, without such support, sales will not increase. The best distributors have exclusive sales teams that explore the technical, financial and advertising support provided by the supplier, allowing these sales teams to outperform non-exclusive sales teams. Our findings fill some of the gaps indicated in the literature such as how sustainability can be better implemented in supply chains and how sales and profits of green products can be increased. Furthermore, a definition of a marketing strategy that can help to optimize the sales costs of green products, which range from 5% to 18%, and that can be applied by suppliers is presented herein.

Abstract: Abstract
Kinematically redundant locomotion systems offer significant potentials with regard to an enhanced mobility on rough and unstructured terrain. These potentials are based on the systems' modular design as well as the given kinematic redundancy. The available additional, i.e. redundant, degrees-of-freedom result in the system's extensive capabilities of posture as well as terrain adaptation. These capabilities can be used to enhance a robot's mobility performance with regard to a given performance metric like e.g. traction and power consumption. The paper at hand summarizes essential considerations with regard to the deployment of kinematic redundancy to achieve enhanced rough terrain mobility focusing on the mechanics of mobile robot posture adaptation and traction optimization.

Abstract: The focal point of this paper is the relatively unknown concept of alternative function fulfilment (AFF), which is a design strategy that can be used to generate new ways of fulfilling a certain function and is referred to in the context of ecodesign. It can be considered an attractive environmental innovation strategy, provided that the increased design space is used to create more sustainable products and services.

This paper explores the AFF concept and discusses the implications of adopting this concept. It thus focuses on how design and business processes may need to change to allow the radical shift towards AFF, in order to facilitate the envisaged significant environmental improvements.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents an optimal control strategy for a hydropower plant retrofitted with a hydrokinetic-powered cascaded pumpback system in dry season. Pumpback operation aims at recycling a part of the down-stream discharge back to the main dam to maintain a high water level to optimise the energy value of the available water. The problem is formulated as a multi-objective optimisation problem to simultaneously minimise the grid pumping energy demand, minimise the wear and tear associated with the switching frequency of the pumps, maximise the restoration of the volume of the dam through pumpback operation and maximise the use of on-site generated hydrokinetic power for pumping operation. The performance of the proposed cascaded model is compared with the classical single pump pumped storage model. Simulation results based on a practical case study shows that the cascaded pumpback model can reduce the pumping energy demand by up to 48.18% and increase the energy yield of the resultant system by up to 47.10% in dry season.

Abstract: The Oxford Commission on Sustainable Consumption aims to promote debate and action to achieve sustainable consumption. It has met four times since it was established in 1999. Commission members have undertaken a number of projects around the world, working with communities to explore pathways to more sustainable consumption. This paper summarises the Commission’s progress and the messages emerging from its work. Current consumption trends are supported by a number of social trends, including individualisation, the spread of the market ethos, urbanisation, globalisation, and the increasing awareness of risk and uncertainty. However, these trends contain the seeds of their own limitation. In particular, increasing discourse about ethics and social goals may be the key to a shift towards more sustainable consumption.

Abstract: The paper presents the main results of a recent study on sustainable use of products. It reveals that strategies of use intensification and useful life extension are environmentally beneficial. Moreover, analysis of household washing and winter sports illustrated that successful implementation of sustainable use patterns occurs as a shift of use regimes. Such regimes are the result of a complex interplay of supply and demand side factors, relationship among actors, technical trajectories, organisational structures etc. One decisive factor is the presence of strategic players, so called “change agents”. In addition, four user types have been identified in a representative survey (“ownership-oriented”, “open-minded”, “consumption-oriented”, “low interest”) to which use intensification and useful life extension can be targeted.

Abstract: Abstract
In spite of the growing awareness and significance of accounting for sustainability aspects in product development, design decision support is still immature in this end compared to other decision support areas, such as product performance and manufacturability. This paper proposes a novel decision support method that combines qualitative sustainability assessment techniques with a quantitative analysis, without losing transparency and still covering a full sustainability perspective. The aim is to contribute to an understanding for how to enable value assessment of sustainability issues already in early product development situations. The method, named Sustainability Assessment and Value Evaluation, combines two qualitative sustainability assessment techniques with a quantitative Net Present Value analysis based on alternative future scenarios. A case study, related to the development of a new high-temperature aero-engine component, illustrates both how the sustainability assessment identifies hotspots and clarifies potential sustainability consequences for a new product technology, and how Net Present Value is used to assess alternative solution strategies based on the hotspot, to facilitate early stage decision-making in design. The paper argues that the method serves two main purposes: i) to make sustainability consequences more concrete and understandable during design concept selection activities, rather than to have an exact measurement, and ii) to simplify and prioritize, systematically asking what is important in the sustainability analysis, rather than to reduce the sustainability problem. The method allows undertaking the sustainability assessment in a more structured way than what happens today in preliminary design, through scenario building based on socio-ecological assessments, including back-casting to cover the longer time perspective. In addition, the Sustainability Assessment and Value Evaluation-method provided the design team of a means for displaying sustainability consequences on an equal basis with other decision support tool results.

Abstract: Abstract
In this proof of concept paper, we address the potential role of forests and vegetation cover as an adaptation tool. In contrast to work addressing the carbon benefits of afforestation, we highlight the potential usefulness of forests as major contributors to the water cycle. Integrating water and carbon cycle benefits into a common objective enhances discussions about the role and value of forests. Herein, we describe a method for increasing regional precipitation in semi-arid environments, thereby potentially helping to increase scarce water resources. The approach capitalizes on observed interactions between forest cover and the hydrologic cycle, with the express aim of returning much needed water resources to an increasingly vulnerable region. The natural processes behind “precipitation recycling” (PR), and vegetation based cross continental transport of atmospheric moisture form the core of this solution. Induced precipitation recycling (IPR) initiates these processes by irrigating afforested land using locally available surplus water. This paper discusses the underlying processes and a proposed demonstration project that functions as both a “proof of concept” and a research testing ground, providing potential validation for promoting future expansion to the wider region. The proposed IPR project utilizes treated wastewater and surplus storm run-off, thus averting additional burdens on the existing water supply, while performing additionally valuable environmental and ecosystem services. IPR provides an alternative approach to supplement existing and typically far costlier plans to address regional water shortages and handle wastewater treatment. The proposed integrated solution would not only contribute positively to regional water supply, but would also provide additional eco-system services and end-products that add value and utility, thereby improving the project’s potential economic viability. This project should be of particular interest to land use and water management planners in the Los Angeles Basin area for whom it is conceived, as well as to those along much of the coastal region in California where climate change-driven drought cycles have been increasing in length and intensity.

Abstract: Abstract
Project-based firms (PBFs) increasingly provide comprehensive solutions that consist of products, product systems and services. In solution businesses, long-term collaborative relationships between solution providers and customers are essential. However, little is still known about how relationship marketing activities should be integrated across organizational units, particularly at the practical level of delivering individual projects and services belonging to complete solutions. In this study, based on a case study of a project-based firm and four of its system delivery projects, we identify eight micro-level integration mechanisms for integrating the activities of the project and service business units at the level of delivering a single solution. The joint participation of both project and service business units in project and service activities over the life cycle of a single delivered system enhances the management of customer relationships between the units, and ensures the continuity of the customer relationship over the system life cycle. The identified integration mechanisms also help PBFs to integrate services into their core business and overcome the problems arising from the discontinuous nature of project business.

Abstract: Summary
Manufacturing industries are increasingly applying alternative business concepts, transforming traditional buyer–supplier relationships into new exchange models of deliveries and payments. In scientific debates on this phenomenon, however, there exist neither consistent terms nor standardised characteristics. This article aims to provide a set of parameters that relate the broad variety of scientific papers in this field of research to a common framework. By applying this framework to multiple case studies, a preliminary typology of new business concepts emerges. These findings have implications for managerial decisions on adopting new business concepts. Our work also suggests future research directions.

Abstract: Abstract
The need for increased levels of reuse and remanufacturing is driving the need for sustainable design of remanufactured products. It is acknowledged that design for remanufacturing benefits the environment. However, it seldom integrates eco-design approaches as it requires ‘life cycle thinking’ with closed-loop life cycles. The objective of this paper is to support eco-design of remanufactured products with design process and data models structuring the activities to be performed and providing the support required. We consider the development of two activities in particular: definition of the target, and environmental analysis. The first activity exploits the concept of RPP (Remanufacturable Product Profile), building on the criteria that are crucial for a successful remanufactured product. The second one exploits the life cycle brick concept that associates each product component with a specific life cycle and related environmental impacts. The models proposed are exploited in a case study concerning the design of remanufactured truck gearboxes.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper studies the link between capital goods supply chains and sociotechnical transitions. Research on the latter has so far tended to focus on sustainability, energy and transport systems. Despite the considerable shift from products to services, supply chains are an integral element of most sociotechnical systems and there seems to be no foreseeable substitute for them. Consequently, for transitions to sustainability to take place, the inertia of supply chains in these systems has to be overcome and their environmental impact reduced. The paper explores this with a system dynamics model of a supply chain. While remanufacturing of used products by the retailer and recycling by the supplier can reduce the environmental impact of the supply chain, competition in the market between new and remanufactured products forces them into a situation where improving business and environmental performance is difficult.

Abstract: This paper presents ideas pertaining to transitions that are envisaged in the steel industry from Cleaner Production (CP) to Systems Innovation. Limits of the socio-technical system and the climate change challenge will induce changes in the production, distribution and consumption patterns of steel and other materials. Insights from industrial economics and evolutionary theory on innovation for sustainable development are needed to assess the rationale behind the adoption and diffusion of new breakthrough technologies named Ultra Low CO2 Steel making (ULCOS). Evolution in material consumption patterns deserves a special research agenda which focuses upon the long term evolution of the consuming sectors as major changes in the infrastructure and products that support our many energy dependent services (mobility, shelter, heat, light, etc.) are expected. These changes will be significantly amplified by greenhouse gas emission constraints.

Abstract: Automotive after sales service is a highly profitable business. Nevertheless, service providers have to deal with an increasing range of variants of products and technologies, shorter life cycles and changing customer demands. In spite of these manifold challenges, after sales departments are often not involved in the early product development stage, nor are customer demands and technical parameters fully considered in the service development processes. Therefore, an integration of service and technology strategies is necessary. This paper presents a framework for this integration that visualises the complex interdependencies and interfaces between service as well as product and car workshop technologies.

Abstract: ABSTRACT
In today's dynamic and highly competitive market organizations are challenged to innovate methods, systems, products and services to ensure their survival. Hospital organizations are not exempt; for it is through innovation in processes of quality they obtain sustainable competitive advantages. The objective of this descriptive-exploratory with qualitative and quantitative analysisis to characterize the environment of innovation in the Hospital Ministro Costa Cavalcanti, located in the western of the state of Paraná. The qualitative survey aimed to construct a timeline with quantity through the factor analysis technique which is the clustering of dimensions for defining the most important aspects of innovation to the hospital. Some key members of the organization were interviewed and were presented the questionnaire of the Minnesota Innovation Research Program (MIRP), a research instrument with 29 dimensions related to the groups of innovation and internal and external factors to the organization. It was found that the researched institution has features of innovative environment and that the dimensions of standardization of procedures, market structure, competition and communication were the most corroborated for accreditation. The accreditation is a quality standard that is significant to small numbers of Brazilian hospitals.

Abstract: Abstract
Care robots are a means to support elderly people affected by physical or mental handicaps to remain as autonomous as possible or regain already lost autonomy (e.g. running stairs). They also support care-takers when working with handicapped. We review the emergence of care robotics technology and particularly offer answers to two research questions: Which organizations and individuals in which countries have been and are active in research and development? How has research and development emerged with regard to activity focus, intensity levels and cooperation?

The analysis rests on the PATSTAT patent and ISI Web of Science publication data. Bibliographic and network analyses are conducted on country, organization (i.e. universities and firms) and individual levels. We find that care robotics research and development activities constantly increased since the late 1970s. Today Japanese universities and firms are the most active players, while in early stages US and European organizations pioneered care robotics research. Starting from six disjunctive small networks, several highly interconnected care robotics research networks evolved. However, most cooperation clusters are still found within the same country. Only few international hubs emerged. Among them two arose around Japanese organizations (ATR, AIST) and Carnegie Mellon University, US.

Abstract: In recent years, the destruction of the ecological environment and the exhaustion of natural resources have become increasingly severe. The demand for environmental protection has attracted worldwide attention. If a company cannot address changes in ecological law, its products will no longer have access to world markets. For this reason, companies should introduce the concept of design for environment (DfE) to the product development process to alleviate the impacts of a product on the ecological environment throughout the product life cycle. To help companies effectively meet the challenges cited above, this study develops an intelligent benchmark-based DfE system for derivative electronic products. The architecture of the intelligent system includes three parts. In the first part, a back-propagation neural network (BPNN) is used to create the analysis of approximate life cycle inventory (LCI). The first part is utilised to estimate the amounts of hazardous chemical substances produced by the material extraction, manufacturing and usage phases as well as the amounts of energy consumed by the production and usage phases. In the second part, data envelopment analysis (DEA) is applied to develop the models of benchmark-based DfE evaluation for a product and a component or part. The models are used to identify which hazardous chemical substances are excessive and to calculate the needed reductions in the quantities of these hazardous chemical substances. The third part of the intelligent DfE system is used to generate analysis and suggestions for improvement in the design of parts or components. The analysis and suggestion model utilises the second-part analytical results and a BPNN to identify concrete directions for improvement and to generate suggestions that can be used to achieve the ultimate goal of DfE.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper examines the principles and practices of Islamic hospitality, outlining the diverse ways in which Islam intersects with ‘hospitality’ and the ‘hospitality industry’. The intangible elements of Islamic hospitality are initially discussed, particularly the importance of the host–guest relationship and differing cultural interpretations. The discussion then evaluates the tangible aspects of Islamic hospitality through identifying trends, developments and challenges within the hotel sector, the food production and service sector, and the festivals and events sector. The work adopts a global perspective, examining Islamic hospitality with reference to both OIC (Organization of Islamic Cooperation) countries and non-OIC countries. The paper also considers new sector opportunities and acknowledges the social difficulties associated with the development of Islamic hospitality within the Western world, notably Islamophobia. Finally, the paper indicates ways forward for future research.

Abstract: Abstract
Many business cases exploiting big data have been realised in recent years; Twitter, LinkedIn, and Facebook are examples of companies in the social networking domain. Other big data use cases have focused on capturing of value from streaming of movies (Netflix), monitoring of network traffic, or improvement of processes in the manufacturing industry. Also, implementation architectures of the use cases have been published. However, conceptual work integrating the approaches into one coherent reference architecture has been limited. The contribution of this paper is technology independent reference architecture for big data systems, which is based on analysis of published implementation architectures of big data use cases. An additional contribution is classification of related implementation technologies and products/services, which is based on analysis of the published use cases and survey of related work. The reference architecture and associated classification are aimed for facilitating architecture design and selection of technologies or commercial solutions, when constructing big data systems.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1% to 93.5% for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design.

Abstract: Abstract
Farm-based tourism has a long tradition in Europe. Using farms to host tourists has become more widely seen as an effective means of supporting local economies and contributing to the preservation of landscapes and cultural heritage in the countryside. Furthermore, farm-based tourism is considered one of the most environmentally sustainable activities among touristic options. Nevertheless, the environmental sustainability of holiday farms still must be assessed. No applications of an environmental assessment method to touristic farms can be found in the literature. The only reference for such application is the PCR (Product Category Rule) basic module on “Accommodation, food and beverage services” developed for the Environmental Product Declaration system®. This document can be used as a reference for declarations for several hosting structures or catering services, nevertheless the performance of this module on touristic farms has not been validated yet.

This study therefore aims to discuss and give practical recommendations when the PCR on accommodations is used for holiday farms thorough an actual case study in Northern Italy.

The farm adopted as case study covers 15 ha of orchards managed according to the organic production protocol. In order to precisely evaluate the farm, the performance of three functional units was tested applying a full Life Cycle Assessment, in accordance with the guidelines and requirements of the ISO 14040. Among other impact categories, the global warming potential of the whole farm in 2011 is 112 tCO2 eq, which corresponds to 232 kg CO2 eq/(guest ∗ night) and 3.32 kg CO2 eq/€. Considering the services in the farm, 81% of the global warming potential is related to the breakfast service, 2% to the room services and the remaining 18% to the agricultural parts of the system.

The results allow us to highlight general key aspects to be considered for the definition of product category rules for such activity including the importance of the choice of the modelling approach, the system boundaries and the functional unit.

Abstract: This paper presents an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and discrete PSO (DPSO) with an enhancement operation by using a self-adaptive evolution strategies (ES). This improved PSO/DPSO is proposed for joint optimization of three-layer feedforward artificial neural network (ANN) structure and parameters (weights and bias), which is named ESPNet. The experimental results on two real-world problems show that ESPNet can produce compact ANNs with good generalization ability.

Abstract: Knowledge translation, as defined by the Canadian Institute of Health Research, is defined as the exchange, synthesis, and ethically sound application of knowledge—within a complex system of interactions among researchers and users—to accelerate the capture of the benefits of research through improved health, more effective services and products, and a strengthened healthcare system. The requirement for this to occur lies in the ability to continue to determine mechanistic actions at the molecular level, to understand how they fit at the in vitro and in vivo levels, and for disease states, to determine their safety, efficacy, and long-term potential at the preclinical animal model level. In this regard, particularly as it relates to long-term disabilities such as cerebral palsy that begin in utero, but only express their full effect in adulthood, animal models must be used to understand and rapidly evaluate mechanisms of injury and therapeutic interventions. In this review, we hope to provide the reader with a background of animal data upon which therapeutic interventions for the prevention and treatment of cerebral palsy, benefit this community, and increasingly do so in the future.

Abstract: Sustainable consumption has been defined as “the consumption of goods and services that meet basic needs and quality of life without jeopardizing the needs of future generations” (OECD, 2002). Lifespan extension of durable products underpins sustainable consumption. This paper describes a novel approach to extend product lifespans by using product servicing that conceptualizes the interactions of a producer, a policy-maker, and multiple consumer segments having different price–demand relationships. We propose a multi-period mathematical optimization model that maximizes the producer's profit while optimizing the prices of different servicing options, production quantities, and inventory levels. A computational study elicits several insights about how the optimal production (or alternatively) consumption quantities are affected by the introduction of product servicing, and the effects of various product characteristics and government incentive or penalty levels on producer's profitability and on product servicing decisions. We conclude that quantitative optimization models are useful for evaluating the impacts of different regulatory policies, assessing the benefits of offering product servicing options, and investing in design for durability and serviceability.

Abstract: Abstract
Maturity in software development is currently defined by models such as CMMI-DEV and ISO/IEC 15504, which emphasize the need to manage, establish, measure and optimize processes. Teams that develop software using these models are guided by defined, detailed processes. However, an increasing number of teams have been implementing agile software development methods that focus on people rather than processes. What, then, is maturity for these agile teams that focus less on detailed, defined processes? This is the question we sought to answer in this study. To this end, we asked agile practitioners about their perception of the maturity level of a number of practices and how they defined maturity in agile software development. We used cluster analysis to analyze quantitative data and triangulated the results with content analysis of the qualitative data. We then proposed a new definition for agile software development maturity. The findings show that practitioners do not see maturity in agile software development as process definition or quantitative management capabilities. Rather, agile maturity means fostering more subjective capabilities, such as collaboration, communication, commitment, care, sharing and self-organization.

Based on the explanation that SDC can be viewed as community, it develops SDC (monetary value) structure by analogy with community (trophic) structure. As energy flow in ecology follows the first and second laws of thermodynamics, monetary value flow in business follows two laws that are similar to the laws of thermodynamics. Based on these laws, as well as throughput accounting and traditional cost accounting, it puts forward a general monetary value flow model in SDC (i.e. in demand chain and in supply chain respectively). Based on the value flow model in SDC, it conceives an SDC evolution model with a case study on the maturity of Toyota Motor Corporation. Based on these two models, it develops an SPMS for firms across SDC with procedural and structural frameworks. The discussion about monetary value flows in business from nature to the final consumers or converse gives a chance to coordinate business with nature. The SPMS that rationally integrates effective evaluation of tiers in SDC and practical product development plans in firm will help firms create a sustainable commerce (e.g. product–service system).

Abstract: Abstract
This exploratory study seeks to explore the current state of design for the environment (DfE) in the development of medical devices; an historically risk averse industry that lags behind others in terms of addressing environmental considerations. A cross-sectional survey of 34 medical device designers, primarily in the UK and USA, was conducted in order to fulfil this objective. Findings indicate that there is significant motivation to enhance DfE practice, but that there are multiple barriers to this. Major barriers identified are a perception of the high cost of DfE, the industry's current reliance on a single-use business model for many current products and a lack of education about DfE topics on all sides. Designers felt that the most significant opportunities to implement DfE are in situations where they are able to exert direct control, mainly in the early stages of the design process. Issues noted include raw material choice and packaging decisions. The nature of single use business models is also critical, pointing towards the needs for a systemic rather than product focus. For this to be achieved, financial rewards must be evident to firms and the changing regulatory landscape might also make a more significant impact.

Abstract: Abstract
Crowdsourcing information systems are socio-technical systems that provide informational products or services by harnessing the diverse potential of large groups of people via the Web. Interested individuals can contribute to such systems by selecting among a wide range of open tasks. Arguing that current approaches are suboptimal in terms of matching tasks and contributors' individual interests and capabilities, this article advocates the introduction of personalized task recommendation mechanisms. We contribute to a conceptual foundation for the design of such mechanisms by conducting a systematic review of the corresponding academic literature. Based on the insights derived from this analysis, we identify a number of issues for future research. In particular, our findings highlight the need for more significant empirical results through large-scale online experiments, an improved dialog with mainstream recommender systems research, and the integration of various sources of knowledge that exceed the boundaries of individual systems.

Abstract: Abstract
On the basis of intended marketing strategy plans, firms design administrative systems to support strategy implementation. In increasingly turbulent business environments—characterized by complexity, scarce resources, and escalating competitive opportunities and threats—firms are forced to alter intended and realize emergent strategies more frequently than ever before. The eventualities of realized marketing strategies may lead to misalignments between the strategy and the existing administrative system designed to support it. To examine performance implications of such misalignments we use Slater and Olson's (2001) taxonomy of marketing strategies. We distinguish between intended and realized plans and we propose an administrative system framework of structural (i.e., centralization, formalization, and specialization) and dynamic (i.e., interdepartmental connectedness and strategic control mechanisms) parameters for the effective implementation of realized strategies. We propose three-way interactions between realized marketing strategies and the dynamic parameters of the system. Research hypotheses on performance implications and responses from 215 marketing executives show performance differences across strategy types and (mis)alignments of the administrative system. Our findings confirm three-way interactions among strategy types, interdepartmental connectedness, and control mechanisms for all realized strategy types.

Abstract: In this article we evaluate over 200 European household services in seven service areas related to household consumption. Services were chosen that contribute to at least two of the three dimensions of sustainable development: environment, social aspects, and economy. The analysed services are called sustainable home services indicating that they are provided to the customers directly at home or on the premises, and that they enhance sustainable development. It appears that the social effects of the assessed services are larger than their environmental and economic benefits. This is presumably at least partly due to the fact that in order to survive in the market, household services must first and foremost be socially beneficial to the users, in other words, improve the quality of life of consumers.

Abstract: Abstract
Manufacturing firms have always delivered services, by supplying spare parts, installing equipment, training employees, or performing maintenance. In competitive markets though, firms seek new ways to differentiate their business, including an increased focus on service, often referred to as service infusion. Of the studies that seek to understand this phenomenon, most focus on large multinational firms; little is known about service infusion in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). This study adopts an explorative approach to investigate how SMEs construct new value constellations that enable value creation through services. The findings, based on in-depth interviews with key informants from 13 SMEs, suggest that there is no predefined transition process for service infusion in SMEs, which seldom have the resources to build new organizational units or create new specialties. Instead, they differentiate themselves through new value constellations within business networks. The heterogeneity of service offerings and business networks means those value constellations take many forms.

Abstract: Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) is performed to quantitatively evaluate all environmental impacts from products, systems, processes and services. However, LCIA does not always provide valuable information for choosing among alternatives with different specifications, functionalities and lifetimes. The objectives of this study are (1) to propose environmental indicators to evaluate environmental efficiency and value qualitatively and quantitatively on the basis of analogies to financial and economic indicators, and (2) to present the application of the indicators. Incremental evaluation using a reference is employed to obtain the environmental indicators. The environmental efficiency indicators are conceptually based on the ratios of reduced environmental burdens returned to environmental burdens required: environmental return on investment, environmental payback period and environmental internal rate of return. The environmental value indicator is the sum of all reduced and required environmental burdens: i.e., environmental net present value. All the environmental indicators can be used to compare and rank the environmental efficiencies or values of alternatives. The environmental efficiency indicators can be applied to a new environmental labeling. The concept of eco-efficiency labeling is developed by combining the environmental efficiency indicators with financial indicators. A case study is performed to illustrate the necessity and importance of the environmental indicators. These environmental indicators can help easily communicate LCIA results in the field of environmental management.

Abstract: In many practical problems inventory managers are confronted with aggregate constraints that result typically from limitations in workspace, workforce, investment or from targeted service levels. In this paper we discuss some multi-product inventory problems with independent items under one or multiple aggregate constraints. We analyze some recent and relevant references grouped into five categories: deterministic lead-time demand, news vendor, base-stock policy, (r, Q) policy and (s, S) policy. We investigate the proposed model formulations, the algorithmic approaches and benefits of a system approach versus an item approach. A multi-product wholesaler case study is presented. Finally we highlight the limitations from a practical viewpoint of these models and point out some possible direction for future improvements.

Abstract: This paper explores the role of the business community in promoting sustainable consumption. While businesses play an important role in shaping social trends, including the growth of material consumption, allegations that individual corporations wield excessive power may have been overstated. Most of the time corporations are simply playing by the rules and culture of the market.

Businesses have mostly assumed that their contribution to sustainability lies in improving eco-efficiency—staying within the current business framework. But sustainable consumption will require wider change, including shifts in the incentives that shape the actions of businesses and others, and a change in the culture that underlies market expectations. Firms, governments, the media and civil society may need to enter a dialogue together to develop a new story about the nature of prosperity and the role of the business community in promoting it. The initiative is most likely to come from civil society.

Abstract: Security forums and discussion groups are pebbled with descriptions of software vulnerabilities that will lead to a loss of data and application integrity. These warnings primarily focus upon popular commercially available software, but this is only the tip of the iceberg. As any security consultant or penetration tester worth their salt can testify, custom applications designed and tuned to satisfy the many demands of a business are typically riddled with flaws, and therefore ripe for attack and exploitation.

Abstract: Abstract
Limited literature provides concrete, theory-based methods for quantifying the effects of sharing capital. This paper describes the potential contribution of portfolio theory to quantify the effects and optimize the employment of capital (human, tangible, financial, and service employing capital) in a theoretical and quantitative manner in the context of sustainability. Insights illustrate how portfolio principles can yield benefits, including the fulfillment of needs using fewer resources, consistent with sustainability. In particular, “pooling” assets to meet uncertain demands from different users of an asset pool may yield benefit from diversification effects. Suggests future research avenues such as the management of high-value, critical-value, and expiring resources to support sustainability.

Abstract: Since the Brundtland report appeared in 1987 various approaches to realising sustainable consumption and production have come into practice. While more traditional approaches like Ecodesign and Design for Sustainability often emphasize optimizing existing products, processes and businesses; more radical approaches like Product-Service Systems and System Innovation for Sustainability emphasize developing new innovative products and services with higher environmental gains. Although these studies increased our understanding of sustainability in relation to product design, they are criticized for failing to draw on existing theoretical frameworks in the organizational innovation literature (Berchicci, 2005).

This paper seeks to explore the innovation process within new ventures driven by sustainability since 1) conventional wisdom suggests that young and new firms have advantages in innovation (Acs and Audretsch, 1990) and as such they are the potential candidates of offering radical solutions to the challenges of sustainability; and 2) there are few studies that address exploiting sustainable product ideas through new organizations. The paper reports on the results of an explorative study involving the use of generative techniques during 19 individual semi-structured interviews with eight entrepreneurs and seven innovation support organizations. The results suggest that the relative impact of internal and external factors on the innovation process change over time as the new organization forms. In addition, creating new businesses from sustainability ideals is influenced by the firms' ability in understanding and managing the differences between intended and created value and in finding an overlap between customer benefits and clearly defined (prioritized) sustainability goals.

Abstract: Abstract
Online purchases are constantly challenged by potential threats which include compromised vendors' security and breaches of customer privacy. To mitigate these concerns, several information assurance mechanisms (e.g., assurance statements and third-party certifications) have gained attention in practice. Despite the wide deployment of assurance mechanisms, it remains largely unknown as to how online consumers interpret these assurance mechanisms and how their concerns affect their purchase decisions. Focusing on two information security assurance mechanisms (i.e., assurance statements and third-party assurance seals services) and three focal concerns of online consumers (i.e., privacy, security, and product and service concerns), this study investigates how security assurance mechanisms influence purchase decisions through alleviating the three focal concerns. The empirical results of the study reveal the relative strength and weakness of the two assurance mechanisms and also uncover the mediating roles of the focal concerns between assurance mechanisms and online consumers' purchase intentions. Post hoc analysis further shows that assurance seals supplement the effects of assurance statements on privacy concern and product and service concern, which is also a new finding to the literature. Finally, results show that concerns on security and privacy displace concern on product and service (a non-information security concern), when effects of the three concerns are concurrently considered by consumers. The implications of findings for both theory and practice are discussed.

Abstract: Process-aware information systems, ranging from generic workflow systems to dedicated enterprise information systems, use work-lists to offer so-called work items to users.

In real scenarios, users can be confronted with a very large number of work items that stem from multiple cases of different processes. In this jungle of work items, users may find it hard to choose the right item to work on next. The system cannot autonomously decide which is the right work item, since the decision is also dependent on conditions that are somehow outside the system. For instance, what is “best” for an organisation should be mediated with what is “best” for its employees.

Current work-list handlers show work items as a simple sorted list and therefore do not provide much decision support for choosing the right work item. Since the work-list handler is the dominant interface between the system and its users, it is worthwhile to provide an intuitive graphical interface that uses contextual information about work items and users to provide suggestions about prioritisation of work items. This paper uses the so-called map metaphor to visualise work items and resources (e.g., users) in a sophisticated manner. Moreover, based on distance notions, the work-list handler can suggest the next work item by considering different perspectives. For example, urgent work items of a type that suits the user may be highlighted.

The underlying map and distance notions may be of a geographical nature (e.g., a map of a city or office building), but may also be based on process designs, organisational structures, social networks, due dates, calendars, etc. The framework proposed in this paper is generic and can be applied to any process-aware information system. Moreover, in order to show its practical feasibility, the paper discusses a full-fledged implementation developed in the context of the open-source workflow environment YAWL, together with two real examples stemming from two very different scenarios. The results of an initial usability evaluation of the implementation are also presented, which provide a first indication of the validity of the approach.

Abstract: In this paper key components in an intelligent product are defined and an associated intelligent product model is formulated. In this model, each product is equipped with an Intelligent Data Unit that connects to a regional back-end service enabler over the Communication Support Infrastructure (e.g. Internet) for lifecycle data transmission. An Intelligent Data Unit is a hardware device that consists of sensors, a controller, memory and data communication interface, which can be embedded into the product to acquire the lifecycle data. A service enabler is a software agent that receives the lifecycle data, and uses it to enable services and provide useful information and knowledge. The analysis and design of a service enabler is described, and a prototype service enabler is developed. It has been demonstrated in field trials that intelligent products built in this way can enable suitable product-related services.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper explores the potential for learning from infrastructure shocks to develop strategic visions of infrastructure. The paper departs from theories of systems innovation, which understand infrastructure transitions as socio-technical re-configurations over long periods of time. The paper presents a complementary hypothesis to those theories about the possibility to catalyze systems change during or as a result of infrastructure shocks. According to this hypothesis, this change is possible because shocks enable higher order learning about infrastructure, which is learning involving a critical evaluation of existing principles and their suitability to complex situations.

The hypothesis is examined empirically by studying the association between different types of infrastructure shock and different types of learning that emerge from those shocks using a meta-analysis of published work on infrastructure shocks. The analysis suggests that while there is considerable evidence of social learning from shocks, the context in which they occur will influence whether or not this is higher order learning. Further research is needed to develop feasible and practical ways to maximize the learning opportunities emerging from infrastructure shocks towards a transition to sustainable and resilient infrastructure.

Abstract: Abstract
We describe how availability of new solar electric propulsion (SEP) technology can substantially increase the science capability of space astronomy missions working within the near-UV to far-infrared (UVOIR) spectrum by making dark sky orbits accessible for the first time. We present a proof of concept case study in which SEP is used to enable a 700 kg Explorer-class observatory payload to reach an orbit beyond where the zodiacal dust limits observatory sensitivity. The resulting scientific performance advantage relative to a Sun–Earth L2 point orbit is presented and discussed. We find that making SEP available to astrophysics Explorers can enable this small payload program to rival the science performance of much larger long development-time systems. We also present flight dynamics analysis which illustrates that this concept can be extended beyond Explorers to substantially improve the sensitivity performance of heavier (7000 kg) flagship-class astrophysics payloads such as the UVOIR successor to the James Webb Space Telescope by using high power SEP that is being developed for the Asteroid Redirect Robotics Mission.

Abstract: In light of increasing pressures to adopt a more sustainable approach to product design and manufacture, the requirement to develop sustainable products is one of the key challenges facing industry in the 21st century. Hence, the concept of developing sustainable products as well as services is evolving as a key element of Cleaner Production. Sustainable product development initiatives (mainly through eco-design) have been evolving for some time to support companies develop more sustainable products. Ireland has been running the highly successful Environmentally Superior Products (ESP) initiative that supports industrial companies to incorporate a more sustainable approach to the development of products and/or services. The lessons learned from the ESP and other global Sustainable Product and Service Developments in industry and research, are being used to develop a method for effective sustainable product and/or service development (SPSD) in industry. The method is designed to provide pragmatic guidance to business and industry for developing sustainable products and services as well as incorporating this approach within existing corporate strategy, cleaner production and product development systems. This method is being developed by the authors at the Environmental Policy and Management Group (EPMG), Department of Environmental Science and Technology, Imperial College London, UK in conjunction with industry and practitioners. The method provides a framework for implementing SPSD throughout the entire lifecycle of a product and/or service. It can be used to identify, assess and implement the options for optimum sustainability in the design and development of a product and/or service. This paper describes the key features of this method.

Abstract: This paper develops a theoretical analysis of performance measurement systems (including related accounting standards) and the composition of the Board in the context of business models driven by complementarities, innovation and intangibles. Performance management systems frame and shape the representation of business performance and risk, while the composition of the Board is designed to control and govern the business processes and disclosure of information over time. Complementarities, intangibles and innovation exacerbate the information asymmetry that characterizes the specific economy of the business firm, making it different from external markets. Therefore, firm-specific information becomes as important as market prices to gauge the past and future performance and risk of the ongoing business firm. Specific knowledge of the firm is therefore required to disclose relevant and reliable information and to monitor corporate executives. This argues for the role of improved historical cost accounting systems coupled with non-independent, proficient Board members.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel integrated system of rapid product development based on rapid prototyping, and develops a networked manufacturing service system which offers better support for the rapid product development in small and medium sized enterprises by taking full advantage of the quickly evolving computer network and information technologies. The architecture of the networked manufacturing service system is presented. Furthermore, some of the key issues, including modelling and planning a manufacturing chain, selecting feasible collaborative manufacturers, queuing a manufacturing task, using the synchronously collaborative work environment, and constructing a suitable running platform, are described in detail. Java-enabled solution, together with web techniques, is employed for building such a networked service system. Finally, an actual example is provided illustrating the application of this service system.

Abstract: There has been increased focus on recycling in Sweden during recent years. This focus can be attributed to external environmental factors such as tougher legislation, but also to the potential gains for raw materials suppliers. Recycling centres are important components in the Swedish total recycling system. Recycling centres are manned facilities for waste collection where visitors can bring, sort and discard worn products as well as large-sized, hazardous, and electrical waste. The aim of this paper was to identify and describe the main flows and layout types at Swedish recycling centres. The aim was also to adapt and apply production theory for designing and managing recycling centre operations. More specifically, this means using lean production principles to help develop guidelines for recycling centre design and efficient control.

Empirical data for this research was primarily collected through interviews and questionnaires among both visitors and employees at 16 Swedish recycling centres. Furthermore, adapted observation protocols have been used in order to explore visitor activities. There was also close collaboration with a local recycling centre company, which shared their layout experiences with the researchers in this project.

The recycling centres studied had a variety of problems such as queues of visitors, overloading of material and improper sorting. The study shows that in order to decrease the problems, the recycling centres should be designed and managed according to lean production principles, i.e. through choosing more suitable layout choices with visible and linear flows, providing better visitor information, and providing suitable technical equipment. Improvements can be achieved through proper planning of the layout and control of the flow of vehicles, with the result of increased efficiency and capacity, shorter visits, and cleaner waste fractions. The benefits of a lean production mindset include increased visitor capacity, waste flexibility, improved sorting quality, shorter time for visits and improved working conditions.

Abstract: Abstract
This article aims to present identified key elements for successful implementation of a strategic sustainability perspective in the early phases of the product innovation process. In-depth interview studies were conducted in six companies within the same corporate group. These, together with a review of literature, previous research and company documents, were a foundation for evaluating if and how a strategic sustainability perspective has been successfully implemented on a day-to-day basis in the product innovation processes of the studied companies. The results are divided into strengths and challenges of the companies with regard to implementing a strategic sustainability perspective in the product innovation process. From this research, eight key elements for successful implementation of a strategic sustainability perspective have been identified. These elements are divided into four categories: organization, internal processes, roles, and tools. It is posited that incorporating these key elements into product innovation processes will encourage a company to have a strategic sustainability perspective, which will support the company's long-term success.

Abstract: Abstract
Literature about the relationship between innovation and sustainability has skyrocketed in the last two decades and new terms have appeared. However, only very few bibliometric analyses have reviewed some of these terms (eco-innovation, environmental innovation, green innovation, and sustainable innovation), and they concluded that such terms are mostly interchangeable. These findings surprise in light of the different positions shown in the innovation for sustainability debate. Our bibliometric analysis tracks meanings and communities associated with these four terms and indicates some overlaps, especially between eco-innovation and environmental innovation. However, we found relevant differences of meanings and communities that reflect the different positions in the innovation for sustainability debate.

Abstract: Abstract
Modern technical standards often include large numbers of patented technologies that are required to implement those standards. These “standard-essential patents” are very valuable assets, and firms that do not own such patents are prepared to spend billions of dollars purchasing them. Whereas large numbers of standard-essential patents are often taken for granted, this study focuses on the process by which companies obtain such patents. Analyzing original data of a large standardization process, we demonstrate how many companies use a strategy we call “just-in-time patenting”: They apply for patents of low technical merit just before a standardization meeting, and then send the patents’ inventors to the meeting to negotiate this patented technology into the standard. Our findings have several implications for standard-setting organizations, patent offices, and policymakers, as the inclusion of just-in-time patents may reduce competition and market entry, increase prices, and unnecessarily complicate the technological content of standards.

Abstract: A simple method for estimating the dynamic properties of isolators is described. The experimental set-up consists of a seismic mass with isolators installed on an electrodynamic shaker. The method enables experiments with a relative wide frequency range and with different excitation levels. In this study, random and sinusoidal excitations are used and analysis is based on the acceleration signals at input and output sides of the isolators. The measured results of helical wire rope isolators are shortly presented.

Abstract: The focus of this paper is on the effects of customer and supplier involvement on competitive advantage in the firm. Using the resource-based view and knowledge-based view of the firm, hypotheses are developed concerning customer involvement, supplier involvement, and competitive advantage. Hierarchical multiple regressions are employed to test the hypothesized relationships. The data used was collected from 139 Chinese manufacturing firms across different industries. Each variable except control variables in the model is measured by a number of scale items. Both reliability and validity (content validity, convergent validity, and discriminate validity) are demonstrated. The results of the regression analysis show that (1) customer involvement has positive impact on product quality, delivery reliability, process flexibility, and customer service; and (2) supplier involvement leads to decreased cost. These findings are interpreted in the context of Chinese manufacturing setting and enhance the understanding of the roles of customer and supplier involvement in China's business environment.

Abstract: Abstract
The implications of Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) for firm performance in low- and medium-tech (LMT) industries are largely unexplored and seem to be limited. In this paper we seek to address this research gap studying how Absorptive Capacity can act as a key factor determining the effectiveness of EO in such a context. Specifically, we adopt the knowledge-based view of the firm and explore the moderating effects of Absorptive Capacity’s Potential and Realized dimensions on the EO–performance relationship in LMT industries. Our regression results based on a lagged dataset of 103 medium-sized firms based in Italy confirm our hypotheses that, in LMT industries, EO has a positive effect on firm performance when coupled with high levels of both Potential and Realized Absorptive Capacity.

Abstract: Life cycle assessment (LCA) is an acknowledged method to assess the contribution of livestock production to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Most LCA studies so far allocate GHG emissions of livestock to marketable outputs. Smallholder systems, however, provide several products and services besides the production of marketable products. We explored how to account for multi-functionality within the LCA method in a case of smallholder milk production in the Kaptumo area in Kenya. Expressed per kg of milk, GHG emissions were 2.0 (0.9–4.3) kg CO2-e, respectively in case of food allocation, 1.6 (0.8–2.9) kg CO2-e in case of economic function allocation and 1.1 (0.5–1.7) kg CO2-e in case of livelihood allocation. The two Carbon Footprint (CF) estimates of milk production considering multi-functionality were comparable to CF estimates of milk in intensive milk production systems. Future LCA's of smallholder systems should account for multi-functionality, because CF results and consequently mitigation options change depending on the functions included.

Abstract: Abstract
Consumer acceptance of smart meters remains crucial in achieving the potential carbon emission reductions offered by advanced metering infrastructures. Given this, the present research used deliberative focus groups to examine what is needed to secure acceptance and engagement from domestic consumers with services, products and ‘offers’ in smarter power systems. Our findings suggest that consumers are able to identify not just threats relating to smart metering initiatives but opportunities as well. In particular, our focus group participants responded positively to the idea of an automated system that could be used to achieve energy savings in combination with time-of-use tariffs. We conclude by outlining suggestions for policy recommendations that may help consumer acceptance of smart meter enabled services be more readily achieved.

Abstract: Abstract
Supplier Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) is a widely-known approach for determining the overall cost generated by a supplier relationship, but its adoption is still limited. The complex calculations involved – and in particular the activity-based costing procedure for computing the cost of managing the relationship – pose a major obstacle to widespread TCO implementation. The purpose of this work is to formulate a Data Envelopment Analysis application (denoted ‘TCO-based DEA’) that can act as a proxy for TCO, and to test its ability to approximate the results of TCO with less effort. The study is based on the analysis of two categories of suppliers (74 in total) of a medium-sized Italian mechanical engineering company. The results show that TCO-based DEA is able to significantly approximate the outcomes of TCO, for both the efficiency indexes and rankings of suppliers, whilst requiring substantially less effort to perform the analysis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to develop a DEA-based tool for approximating TCO and to test it in a real-world setting. The research shows significant potential within the supply chain management field. In particular, TCO-based DEA can be used for analysing suppliers’ performance, rationalising and reducing the supplier base, assisting the negotiation process.

Abstract: At the Delft University of Technology, a new model has been developed to describe the sustainability of products, the ‘EVR model’. This model comprises two concepts:•
the ‘virtual eco-costs’ as a LCA-based single indicator for environmental impact
•
the EVR (Eco-costs/Value Ratio) as an indicator for eco-efficiency


In this publication, an experiment is described to test whether the EVR model leads to a good understanding of the eco-efficiency, of a product–service combination. In this experiment three separate groups of 8-11 people were asked to rank four alternative solutions of a product–service system (the after sales service and the maintenance service of an induction plate cooker) both in terms of sustainability and of general preference. The three respective groups were:•
customers (among whom representatives of consumer organizations)
•
business representatives from the manufacturing company of the induction plate cookers
•
governmental representatives (employees of the Dutch ministries of environmental affairs and economic affairs, and of the Dutch provinces as well as consultants involved in governmental policies), all experts in the field of sustainability


The basic idea was to ask each group to rank the four alternatives after three levels of information input:
Level 1: basic explanation of the four alternatives. Some major features and characteristics such as price were given, but no environmental data.

Level 2: on explanation of an LCA of the four alternatives, given in nine impact classes and the Eco-indicator 95.

Level 3: an explanation of the EVR model and the EVR data of the four alternatives.


Each time the group was asked to rank the proposed alternatives in terms of expected environmental performance and of ‘best choice in general’ (‘Which system would you have bought in a real life situation?’).

From the experiments it can be concluded that:•
The concept of eco-costs was accepted by the majority of the non-experts: they based their ranking on it. and they preferred it rather than direct LCA output or the damage based eco-indicator 95 data.
•
The environmental experts in the governmental group did not directly accept the concept of eco-costs model (they wanted in depth information first); they tended to stick to their existing knowledge of LCA data and the Eco-indicator 95.
•
‘Overall’ preferences of the customers and business representatives were primarily ranked on the ‘perceived value’/costs ratio of the product–service combination; the sustainability of the product–service combination played a secondary role.

Abstract: Abstract
Designing environmentally benign businesses requires the selection of an appropriate combination of services that can facilitate life cycle options (LCOPs), reduce the environmental load, and satisfy user needs. This study proposes a method of identifying services for facilitating the effectiveness of LCOPs and combining them with those identified based on user needs. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated by applying it to a managed document service.

Abstract: A hybrid inversion method that combines a Bayesian Network Classifier (BNC) with shape adaptive neighborhoods (SANs) is proposed for the classification of 10-m resolution remote sensing images. BNC uses a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to describe variable relationships. We define feature bands and land use/cover types as the feature and class variables, respectively, and describe them as nodes in the DAG. BNC only uses the posterior probability of the class node, and predicts the class with the highest posterior probability. A SAN, containing spectral, textural, and shape features, is used to study the Bayesian network structure, in contrast to methods which only use spectral features. The classification results of the proposed SAN-BNC are compared with those of the spectral-based Maximum Likelihood Classifier (MLC), the SAN-based MLC, and the SAN-based Support Vector Machine (SVM) using Guangzhou as a case study. Our results show that BNC and SVM have superior inference abilities relative to MLC. Ten meter resolution images will furnish better classification results using the proposed SAN-BNC procedure.

Abstract: High-tech products and services are characterized as having short life cycles and being state-of-the-art. The life cycles of software products and services are affected by the changes in the hardware and software industries; and the changes in the needs and requirements of software users in variety of industries. To survive in the marketplace, software products and services ought to be responsive to these changes. To be so, they must have cutting-edge features and functionalities, associated with the users’ unmet needs and requirements. Unlike hardware devices, cutting-edge technologies in software products and services are not exogenous to the system design and development—they are built into the software systems during the design and development processes. The cutting-edge technologies enable the developer to improve the software product and service in cost and time effective ways. Therefore, software products and services in order to succeed in the marketplace must be high tech. In other words, being high tech is not a product or service characteristic of software products and services—it is a new product development strategy.

Abstract: The idea of services replacing products is increasingly offered as a solution to making the production and consumption patterns of the affluent consumers more sustainable. However, the discussion about ‘sustainable services’ or ‘sustainable product–service systems’ tends to emphasize the eco-efficiency perspective, rather than explicitly capture all sustainability aspects. Social or socioeconomic considerations are often forgotten or by-passed without scrutiny. This paper argues that there is the need for a concept of sustainable services in which the social sustainability aspect is also recognized with equal attention. Since a major part of private consumption occurs in the household context-living at home and moving to and from it—this paper will put forth the concept of sustainable homeservices and will suggest a way to assess sustainability of services directed to households. For assessing the sustainability of services directed to households, a set of indicators relating to the ecological, social and economic dimensions of sustainability is proposed. With the aim of giving an idea of how to assess homeservices in practical terms, the paper will also exemplify how one could operationalize these indicators on an ordinal rating scale. The conclusion is that it is possible to assess the sustainability of a homeservice in a relative fashion, using ‘no service’ or the ‘product alternative’ as the point of comparison.

Households alone have a limited capacity to influence their consumption choices, because other actors set the frame. For this reason, institutional arrangements for making services easily available to households are outlined. It appears that housing organizations have a central role in the alternative option for organizing the supply of service provision. They are involved in five of the seven alternative ways of supplying services that could be identified. The role of the housing organization can vary from direct supply to lighter forms, such as cooperative arrangements with external service providers, or resident involvement.

Abstract: Dieless incremental sheet metal forming is restricted by different effects. Some of the major issues are the limited maximum draw angle, a commonly reduced surface quality of the deformed areas and the low geometrical accuracy in concave features.

This paper deals with both theoretical and experimental investigations on the influence of superimposed pressure induced by two moving forming tools. It has been verified that the stated issues can be improved dependent on the applied force and the relative position of the two tools. Applying this approach one major achievement has been an increase of 12.5% of the maximum draw angle.

Abstract: Through the interconnectedness of global business, the local consumption of products and services is intervening in the hydrological cycle throughout the world to an unprecedented extent. In order to address the unsustainable use of global freshwater resources, indicators are needed which make the impacts of production systems and consumption patterns transparent. In this paper, a revised water footprint calculation method, incorporating water stress characterisation factors, is presented and demonstrated for two case study products, Dolmio® pasta sauce and Peanut M&amp;M's® using primary production data. The method offers a simple, yet meaningful way of making quantitative comparisons between products, production systems and services in terms of their potential to contribute to water scarcity. As such, capacity is created for change through public policy as well as corporate and individual action. This revised method represents an alternative to existing volumetric water footprint calculation methods which combine green and blue water consumption from water scarce and water abundant regions such that they give no clear indication about where the actual potential for harm exists.

Abstract: Clustering is one of the key drivers for regional economic growth. Development of clusters is a dynamic process shaped by a variety of internal and external factors such as availability of skilled labor, presence of functioning networks and partnerships, technological changes, and market competition, etc. As a result, the patterns of cluster growth may differ from one another. Although each cluster is unique in some way, previous research has attempted to identify few simplified models of evolution of clusters. In this study, we briefly reviewed the literature on a variety of models of clusters. Based on these models, we investigated 15 hi-performing metropolitan-based clusters in the United States, covering communications equipment manufacturing, information technology, and biopharmaceutical industries, in order to find out the similarities and differences between real-world clusters. Specifically, by examining the composition of these high-tech clusters, we attempted to find out the following: 1) What are the typologies of these technology clusters? 2) Whether different industries tend to support different cluster typologies? and 3) How do clusters change their typologies over time? Our analysis results suggest that the real-world clusters rarely feature any single type of typology; a mixed type of typology is much more prevalent in reality.

We also found that different industries tend to support different types of cluster typologies. In other words, an individual cluster's typology is to some extent shaped by the industry group it belongs to. In addition, we note that, as a cluster goes through different stages of its lifecycle, its typology may change significantly.

International management (IM) literature identifies several important skill sets (namely, self-maintenance, perceptual, interpersonal, language and communication skills) that are important for expatriates’ cross-cultural management. However, how skills influence each other and work synergistically towards expatriate competence has not been well examined. Based on the theoretical perspectives of learning, social dynamics and the IM stream, we develop an integrative model to investigate the joint effects of skills on cross-cultural competence (CCC), by surveying and interviewing Chinese expatriate managers. We find that self-maintenance skills, interpersonal skills, and language skills do not relate to CCC directly, while perceptual skills contribute to CCC mainly through communication skills. Our study demonstrates that competence goes beyond understanding local culture and lies in the ability to effectively interact and communicate within the host context. This study contributes to expatriate literature not only by revealing the skill – CCC mechanisms, but also by extending knowledge into an emerging market context which provides theoretical and practical guidance for competence-building of expatriates from China.

Abstract: Background
Uncontrolled haemorrhage is a leading cause of prehospital death after military and civilian trauma. Exsanguination from extremity wounds causes over half of preven military combat deaths and wounds to the anatomical junctional zones provide a particular challenge for first responders. Commercial products have been developed, which claim to outperform standard gauze bandages in establishing and maintaining non-surgical haemostasis. Since 2004, two advanced haemostatic dressing products, HemCon and QuikClot have been widely deployed in military operations. Newer products have since become available which aim to provide more efficient haemostasis than and thus supersede HemCon and QuikClot.
Aim
To conduct a systematic review of clinical and preclinical evidence to compare the relative efficacy and safety of available haemostatic products, which are of relevance to pre-hospital military and civilian emergency medical providers.
Method
An English language literature search was performed, using PubMed® and Web of Knowledge® Databases, with cross-referencing, focussed product searches and communication with product manufacturers. For studies employing animal models, the injury model was required to produce fatal haemorrhage. Products were categorised by primary mode of action as either factor concentrators, mucoadhesive agents or procoagulant supplementors.
Results
From 60 articles collated, 6 clinical papers and 37 preclinical animal trials were eligible for inclusion in this review. Products have been tested in three different types of haemorrhage model: low pressure, high volume venous bleeding, high pressure arterial bleeding and mixed arterial-venous bleeding. The efficacy of products varies with the model adopted. Criteria for the ‘ideal battlefield haemostatic dressing’ have previously been defined by Pusateri, but no product has yet attained such status. Since 2004, HemCon (a mucoadhesive agent) and QuikClot (a factor concentrator) have been widely deployed by United States and United Kingdom Armed Forces; retrospective clinical data supports their efficacy. However, in some recent animal models of lethal haemorrhage, WoundStat (mucoadhesive), Celox (mucoadhesive) and CombatGauze (procoagulant supplementor) have all outperformed both HemCon and QuikClot products.
Conclusion
HemCon and QuikClot have augmented the haemostatic capabilities of the military first aid responder, but newer products demonstrate potential to be more effective and should be considered as replacements for current in service systems. These products could have utility for civilian pre-hospital care.

Abstract: In an ever more globalised world IT (Information Technology) managers increasingly have to support value creation within inter-organisational collaboration settings. Such organisational forms with their inherent complexity require specific approaches for their IT management within. Especially important for unleashing the chances of networked arrangements is the right form of IT Governance. Choosing the right arrangement for IT Governance is heavily dependent on understanding the concepts on which such business constellations are built. In this paper we provide therefore first a systematically derived, graph-based perspective on the key terms of inter-organisational collaboration. Based on this understanding of concepts and structured representations of inter-organisational dependencies we present interorganisational governance practices for IT. Specifically, we assign accountabilities to top executive roles from both IT and business. By keeping a holistic perspective, the insights gained in this study are highly relevant for strategic information management in terms of Business-IT Alignment as well as monitoring and controlling of inter-organisational information infrastructures in a rapidly changing business environment.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays the competition among companies, joined to the environmental protection rules, is so compelling that they should not only be on the top of technology in they area, but also run their business according to life-long models. The emphasis on the product post-sale life is common for these models. The most popular model is Product Lifecycle Management, for manufacturing companies, or Service Engineering, for service-oriented companies, and, for both, common paradigms are in maintenance, with conformance-to-use certification. The paper introduces basic research results achieved in application of Ambient Intelligence, and suggests considering maintenance as a cross section of the two business paradigms.

Abstract: A 95-year annual record of skeletal Sr / Ca, Mg / Ca, δ18O and δ13C is reported for a non-tropical, slow-growing coral (Cladocora caespitosa) collected in the north-western Mediterranean Sea. Significant correlations were found for Sr / Ca vs. Mg / Ca, Sr / Ca vs. δ18O and for δ18O vs. δ13C, indicating the possibility of using this non-tropical species as a climatic and paleoclimatic biomarker. The Sr / Ca and Mg / Ca ratios as well as the δ18O composition in corals were compared against the Sea Surface Temperature (SST) data of IGOSS (Integrated Global Ocean Service System Products) for the north-western Mediterranean region. The Sr / Ca ratios show a significant correlation with the SST, according to the following equation: Sr / Ca (mmol/mol) = 11.25 (± 0.38) − 0.079 (± 0.026) SST (°C). The δ18O data do not appear to fit with the SST interval used, since the regression obtained is non-significant. This implies that other factors apart from temperature, such as the δ18Oseawater, are affecting the coral δ18O. The relationship between Mg / Ca ratio and SST is not statistically significant. This is probably due to the heterogeneities in magnesium content found among the coral microstructures (calcification centres, surrounding fibres and dissepiments), along with other factors, such as the presence of microborings and/or organic matter.

The annual record indicates a history of SST variation that is consistent with the instrumental measurements, and strongly suggests the feasibility of using this non-tropical coral as a new proxy for the Mediterranean Sea.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite strong evidence of substantial impact on the bottom line, most companies counter-intuitively neglect the pricing function — as do most scholars. Although pricing is gaining in popularity, only a few articles published in major marketing journals focus on it, and scholars have long asked how organizational and behavioral characteristics of firms affect the link between pricing practices and firm performance. To address these practical and theoretical deficits, we surveyed 507 professionals involved in account and sales management at business-to-business (B2B) firms from around the world to measure the influence of five organizational factors on sales collective confidence associated with pricing and relative firm performance. Results demonstrate that four of the five factors (pricing capabilities, delegation of pricing authority, incentive and goal systems, and knowledge before negotiation) positively and significantly influence sales collective confidence associated with pricing. In turn, we find collective confidence in the sales force to be significantly and positively related to relative firm performance, suggesting that firms that are able to design organizations and allocate resources in a way that maximizes pricing confidence can achieve superior financial outcomes. In aggregate, these organizational factors promote competitive advantage and comparative firm performance.

Abstract: The potential environmental benefits of moving from a product-based economy to a functional economy involving greater use of services is a subject of increasing interest and debate in the field of eco-efficiency. This paper provides a typology and fuller analysis of eco-efficient producer services than hitherto reported. Three broad classes of service are described and assessed: product based including product results, product utility and product extension; electronic substitution and information based. Examples of each are drawn from a major study on the successes and barriers of eco-services in Europe. The paper concludes that while there are a number of areas of success, there are considerable barriers to wider development and uptake of such services, and that many of the more successful service applications are not necessarily driven by environmental considerations. The paper warns that the shift from products to services cannot be assumed to be eco-efficient and there are a number of rebound effects which need to be carefully analysed.

Abstract: Cloud federation can allow individual Cloud providers working collaboratively to offer best-effort services to service customers. However, the current federated Cloud computing model is not appropriate for computationally intensive Real-time Online Interactive Applications (ROIA). This paper discusses how we propose and develop a business-oriented federated Cloud computing model where multiple independent infrastructure providers can cooperate seamlessly to provide scalable IT infrastructure and QoS-assured hosting services for ROIA. The distinct features of this proposed Cloud federation model is its business layer that can provide an enhanced security features and can trigger the on-demand resource provisioning across multiple infrastructure providers, hence helping to maximize the customer satisfaction, business benefits and resources usage.

Abstract: WHO Collaborating Centres (CCs) form part of an international collaborative network set up by WHO in support of its mandated programme at the country, intercountry, regional, interregional and global levels, as appropriate. As part of its mandate in the area of biologicals, WHO has broadened the scope of its work and has expanded the range of activities devoted to the establishment of international standards for vaccines. In line with global immunization goals, the need for standards for evaluation of quality, safety and efficacy of new vaccines, as well as those that have been in use for a long time, has significantly increased. Furthermore, complex issues related to new production methodologies, more sophisticated techniques for characterization and laboratory testing, and for nonclinical and clinical evaluation of vaccines have raised a number of regulatory challenges for WHO when requested to assist its Member States. In this context, CCs in the area of standardization of vaccines and biotherapeutics (excluding blood products) have provided technical assistance and have broadened the scope of their work over time. In the area of standardization and regulatory evaluation of vaccines, WHO currently has six CCs as well as one candidate centre for which the designation process has been initiated and a further three candidate centres with great potential. The purpose of the meeting held on 24–26 April 2012 was to improve understanding of WHO's priorities in setting standards, to facilitate their implementation, and to increase transparency of the roles and responsibilities of CCs. The meeting was also an excellent opportunity to explore possibilities for improving collaboration between WHO and CCs, as well as among CCs themselves by working as a CC network. All CCs expressed a wish for increased interaction, information-sharing, collaboration and other ways of working together that may lead to cross-fertilization between the CCs. Synergy was recognized as a significant mechanism for leveraging existing resources in responding to global public health challenges and in addressing WHO's priorities. Agreement was reached for operating as a network of CCs.

Abstract: Most studies of the effects of the Bayh-Dole Act have focused on universities. In contrast, we analyze patenting activity at two prominent national laboratories, Sandia National Laboratories and the National Institute of Standards and Technology before and after the enactment of this legislation and the Stevenson-Wydler Act. It appears as though the enactment of Bayh-Dole and the Stevenson-Wydler Act were not sufficient to induce an increase in patenting at these labs. However, the establishment of financial incentive systems, embodied in passage of the Federal Technology Transfer Act, as well as the allocation of internal resources to support technology transfer, stimulated an increase in such activity.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper proposes a typology for provider roles in defining business services. The starting point of the study is the underlying rationale of much of the service purchasing literature that buyers have or can easily access the necessary know-how to procure business services. If this does not hold, the implication is that buying firms would shy away from buying complex services. An alternative perspective recognizes that purchasing business services requires its own set of sourcing capabilities, which may be lacking. Buying firms may have limited know-how in terms of defining and articulating their requirements or not be fully aware of them in the first place. However, the buyer's lack of sourcing capabilities need not be an injunction to internalize the service. In these circumstances, service providers step in, help buying firms specify their requirements and play a key role in defining what is procured and how. We build on this interactive view of service definition to undertake a comparative case analysis of four business service contracting situations arrayed along two dimensions — buyer perceived uncertainty and provider's buyer-specific experience. We conclude that service providers play different roles in each case. These are classified as translating, re-engineering, developing, and fine-tuning roles.

Abstract: Abstract
Customer participation is considered necessary for the delivery of effective Knowledge Intensive Business Services (KIBS). However, for different reasons, KIBS customers are not always able to participate actively during the delivery process and providers have to compensate for this in order to deliver effective solutions. We conducted case-based research to understand how KIBS providers do this. The three cases studied suggest that, besides customer education, providers use preventive and problem-management strategies to counterbalance limited customer participation. These three strategies are used in a complementary way and are enabled by the expertise of KIBS providers. They also contribute to the delivery of effective KIBS. The research outcomes refine the existing knowledge of customer participation in KIBS, which has so far focused mainly on the causes and consequences of it and overlooked other related issues. Our results also suggest that practitioners could use the level of customers' ability and willingness to participate as segmentation criteria and then define their strategies and allocate their resources accordingly.

Abstract: Recommender systems provide personalized recommendations on products or services to user. The amount information handled by this type of systems is steadily growing. Furthermore, the development of recommendation systems is a difficult task due to the implementation of complex algorithms and metrics. For this reason, the success of recommendation systems depends on preliminary design decisions such as the most adequate similarity metric, the right process to infer proactive recommendations, for mentioning a few. This decision determines the process for generating recommendations and also impacts quality and user’s satisfaction. In this paper, we propose RESYGEN, a Recommendation System Generator. RESYGEN allows the user to generate such kind of systems in an easy and friendly way. Furthermore, RESYGEN allows the generation of multi-domain systems such as music, video, books, travel, hardware, software, and food to mention a few. RESYGEN is based in the selection of the best distance metrics for nominal, ordinal, numeric and binary attributes, with the aim to reduce complexity for non-expert users and also to facilitate the selection of the metric which best fits to the data type. A system generated through RESYGEN has several interesting elements such as ratings, recommendations, cloud tag, among others. We performed a qualitative evaluation with the aim of comparing other recommender systems against systems generated by RESYGEN. The results shows that generated systems by RESYGEN, comprise the basic elements of a recommendation system.

Abstract: Abstract
A mathematical model is developed for integrated flow planning in forward and after-sales supply chains of a company supplying repairable product-warranty packages to markets. Ignoring their interactions, these two supply chains are usually planned separately in literature. We consider demand- and supply-side variations in pre- and after-sales demands and qualified outflow of the SCs’ facilities. We show that to neutralize the impact of variations, orders should be amplified by moving from the downstream to the upstream of chains. Results of an example from the gear industry show what interdependencies exist between the company’s retail price, service levels, and warranty strategies.

Abstract: Information retrieval (IR) is a well-established research and development area. Document formats such as SGML (Standard Generalised Mark-up Language) and XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language) have become widely used in recent years. Traditional IR systems demonstrate limitations when dealing with such documents, which motivated the emergence of structured document retrieval (SDR) technology intending to overcome these limitations. This paper reviews the work carried out from the inception to the development and application of SDR in engineering document management. The key issues of SDR are discussed and the state of the art of SDR to improve information access performance has been surveyed. A comparison of selected papers is provided and possible future research directions identified. The paper concludes with the expectation that SDR will make a positive impact on the process of engineering document management from document construction to its delivery in the future, and undoubtedly provide better information retrieval performance in terms of both precision and functionality.

Abstract: The mobility of the popular goods on the shelves will have a crucial impact on the store sales. For retailers, the seasonal or news-induced demand for commodity will have the flocking effect or business opportunity lasting for some time; if the product shortage occurs, consumers will immediately turn to other stores, and the sale opportunity will be missed.

Traditionally, to confirm the demand for commodity, the stores primarily employ the point-of-sale (POS) system to monitor the inventory of goods, but the turnover rate of popular goods is very demanding. The inventory information supplied by the POS system is that generated after the ledger-closing stage, and it cannot precisely match the actual quantity of goods on the shelves. Therefore, in order to prevent the monetary loss due to the information gap, we propose the “intelligent service-integrated platform”, which employs the software agent as the framework to construct the integrated information system mechanism. We also employ the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology to realize the smart shelf as the trigger point for the retrieval of commodity message. At the same time, we develop the interactive information platform to provide the consultation and promotion service of goods. The overall framework will help enhance the performance of the sales outlets and improve the customer service, while addressing the time effect issue of the popular commodity.

Abstract: The traditional distinction between manufacturing and services, both in relation to products and indeed, the actual companies themselves, is getting blurred. Increasingly services are becoming a major part of the company offerings in manufacturing sector. In order to compete in a transformed environment, companies need to assess the cost of their service offerings properly to stay competitive. The research in this paper is focused on enhancing existing knowledge in cost estimation models for availability type support service contracts that focus on equipment availability targets and predefined service levels. Most of the current studies concentrate on product cost estimation rather than on services. The difficulty of this task lies in properly estimating the costs of activities during the long lasting contracts, which in some cases may reach even several decades.

Abstract: Firms, like consumers, differ in their likelihood and speed to adopt innovations, i.e. new products, systems or services. Differences in adoption status are generally explained by scholars based on (i) particular characteristics of the firm and of the new products (micro factors) and (ii) the type of industry the firms are in (meso factors). This study adds to the literature by investigating if national culture (a macro factor) adds to the explanation of differences in adoption status for firms operating in different countries. A large-scale empirical study was carried out in 10 European countries concerning the adoption of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software by medium-sized companies. Key finding is that variables describing national cultural highly significantly explain variance in adoption decisions in addition to the traditional micro and meso variables. These findings support the proposition that cultural differences between countries, even within the EU, are still so large that they impact the likelihood of adoption by companies operating in different countries. The findings have important implications for business-to-business companies expanding in foreign countries with new products and services.

Abstract: Over the last decade, emerging information communication technologies have changed our stereotype of manufacturing and service companies. Now products equipped with embedded systems can be wirelessly networked, which leads to gathering and analyzing product status, and taking appropriate actions for maintenance operations during product lifecycle in an ubiquitous way. In this environment, it is necessary to determine the appropriate memory size of embedded systems for minimizing total maintenance system costs because the memory cost is a main cost factor for implementing the ubiquitous maintenance environment. We call it memory size decision problem in this study. We have formulated this problem with a non-linear model having constraints. The decision variable is the memory size of each embedded system. To solve this problem, we have proposed a meta heuristic search method based on genetic algorithms. To show the usefulness of the proposed heuristic, we have carried out computational experiments.

Abstract: Roboforming is a dieless, incremental, robot-based sheet metal forming process for cost-effective manufacture of prototype parts and small batch sizes. Its principle is based on flexible shaping by means of a freely programmable path-synchronous movement of two industrial robots driving workpiece-independent forming tools.

The novelty of this process leads to a huge need for further research. The main task is to increase the geometrical accuracy which is primarily influenced by the compliance of the involved serial robot structures and the springback effects of the workpiece. An offline model-based and an online sensor-based strategy to increase part accuracy are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
A major shift in support and maintenance logistics for complex engineering systems over the past few years has been observed in defence and aerospace industry. Availability contracting, a novel approach in this area and a special type of performance based contract, is replacing traditional service procurement practices. The service provider is measured against an equipment availability target set by the customer and rewarded on savings achieved. The performance of such contracts depends on proper utilization of right mix of labour resources. Contemporary literature on resource modelling has not attempted at modelling the entire aircraft maintenance line along with the labour resources. This research work aims to improve resource utilization in availability type contracts by simulating human resources and processes in an aircraft maintenance line.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainable development refers to an economic, environmental and social development that meets the needs of the present and does not prevent future generations from fulfilling their needs. In this context, businesses play an important role. However, progress towards sustainable development has been slow, indicating the need for more concrete guidance that will allow businesses to act strategically and successfully in a sustainable way. This theoretical paper connects three distinct, but complementary, dimensions of strategic management as viewed from the perspective of sustainability in order to encourage the integration of sustainability issues into corporate activities and strategies. These three dimensions are: strategy process, strategy content and strategy context. Sixteen propositions related to these dimensions have been developed to explore the contributions of corporate sustainability management to the creation of value for businesses, society and nature. This theoretical discussion contributes to existing research in that it reveals relationships between strategic management and sustainable development and provides an agenda for further empirical research.

Abstract: This paper is a contribution to the debate on the redefinition of needs and perspectives of university level education in the field of sustainable design. It discusses the role of design research in relation to the production of new educational forms, methods and tools for a new generation of designers (and designer educators) enabling them to more effectively confront the transition towards a sustainable society. The paper is based on two premises; Firstly: in today’s climate there is a need for a general redefinition of education, as a result of the influence of new technological opportunities and changed socio-cultural conditions. Secondly: the design activity itself needs to be redefined in order to positively and effectively contribute to the radical change required by the transition towards a sustainable society. Industrial designer, educators and other design practitioners are all searching for ways to enhance their environmental capabilities and to produce sustainable designs. The academic discipline of design education in Italy (at the higher educational level) has responded by broadening its scope to produce more ‘environmentally skilled’ designers sensitive to issues of sustainable production and consumption. The Interdepartmental Research Centre in Innovation for Environmental Sustainability (CIR.IS) of the Politecnico di Milano University has developed an innovative and highly flexible response to these new design education needs. A set of interrelated projects—co-ordinated by the author—is outlined in the following paragraphs. These projects are funded by the Italian Environmental Protection Agency (ANPA). A university network (RAPI.RETE) has been established and a group of innovative and technologically advanced tools (ECO.CATHEDRA, ECO.OFFICINA, ECO.DISCO and DPS.MANUAL) are being developed to support teachers and students in the educational content and processes. The tools are now going to be distributed (free of charge) in Italian Universities and, both the ANPA and the CIR.IS have given their consent for their translation/adaptation into other languages (without charge).

Abstract: Abstract
The paper concerns which sustainability-oriented Functional Products (FP) customer values companies, who also provide products and services, consider as important to communicate to customers when offering or planning to offer FP. Currently, the manufacturing industry is showing increasing interest in adding offerings based on additionally complex business models as opposed to merely offering products and services. This is considered necessary if companies are to continue to be able to innovate and stay competitive and profitable in global competition. A considerable focus is directed towards performance- or result-based business models. FP is one such business model, where the provider offers a function to customers at an agreed-upon level of availability, productivity or efficiency. FP comprise the following four main constituents: hardware, software, service support system and management of operation, which together deliver value to customers on a long-term basis. The paper proposes a set of FP sustainability-oriented customer values which are categorized according to the sustainability aspects: economic, ecological and societal, and the set is further analyzed from a regulatory and legal perspective.

Abstract: Recommender systems are powerful tools that allow companies to present personalized offers to their customers and defined as a system which recommends an appropriate product or service after learning the customers’ preferences and desires. Extracting users’ preferences through their buying behavior and history of purchased products is the most important element of such systems. Due to users’ unlimited and unpredictable desires, identifying their preferences is very complicated process. In most researches, less attention has been paid to user’s preferences varieties in different product categories. This may decrease quality of recommended items. In this paper, we introduced a technique of recommendation in the context of online retail store which extracts user preferences in each product category separately and provides more personalized recommendations through employing product taxonomy, attributes of product categories, web usage mining and combination of two well-known filtering methods: collaborative and content-based filtering. Experimental results show that proposed technique improves quality, as compared to similar approaches.

Abstract: Abstract
Two alternative approaches for an integrated municipal solid waste management system (MSW-MS) have been confronted in the province of Gipuzkoa, in the north of Spain, during the last decade. While one of them prioritizes energy recovery from mixed residual waste in an incineration plant, the other approach gives precedence to material recovery of separately collected waste. Which system would present a lower environmental impact and be more desirable from a sustainability perspective? Answering this question is hindered by the fact that recovered energy and materials are not directly comparable or directly substitutable with each other.

Based on the powerful framework provided by life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, this work performs a comparative LCA of overall environmental impacts of these two alternative approaches, showing that comparisons of alternative systems in terms of direct energy recovery or direct material recovery should be avoided in favor of other indicators already proposed in the LCA framework, such as the Cumulative Energy Demand category from Ecoinvent, or the global warming potential and the Abiotic Resources Depletion categories from the CML 2001 method.

Applying the LCA framework, this work shows that when a high share of waste is collected separately, and processes assumed in the background system are adequately characterized, especially the production of the electricity mix, then prioritizing material recovery provides better results even in environmental categories tightly related to fossil energy consumption, such as the global warming potential impact category.

Abstract: Abstract
In the functional product business model, a customer is provided with functionality at a guaranteed level of availability under a pre-agreed pricing structure whilst the provider retains ownership of the hardware and provides a service support system to deliver services such as maintenance. The ability to accurately predict the costs of supporting functional product contracts is crucial to the provider in correctly pricing those contracts and for the development and implementation of an efficient service support system. Since the costs incurred are performance based and accumulated over a long duration, they are difficult to predict without effective modelling and decision support tools. This paper discusses a decision support tool that has been developed to provide detailed analysis of the predicted long-term costs of supporting functional product contracts. The tool features a web based user interface to allow collaborative use of the tool by multiple users. The cost predictions are obtained through a discrete event simulation model that emulates the performance of the hardware and service support system used by the provider to fulfil the functional requirements specified in the contracts. The simulations are executed on automatically provisioned remote web based servers, meaning that the computing resources utilised are not limited by the user’s client device. The tool is demonstrated via application to an industrial test case.

Abstract: Service orientation (SO) is a relevant promising candidate for accommodating rapidly changing user needs and expectations. One of the goals of adopting SO is the improvement of reusability, however, the development of service-based system in practice has uncovered several challenging issues, such as how to identify reusable services, how to determine configurations of services that are relevant to users’ current product configuration and context, and how to maintain service validity after configuration changes. In this paper, we propose a method that addresses these issues by adapting a feature-oriented product line engineering approach. The method is notable in that it guides developers to identify reusable services at the right level of granularity and to map users’ context to relevant service configuration, and it also provides a means to check the validity of services at runtime in terms of invariants and pre/post-conditions of services. Moreover, we propose a heterogeneous style based architecture model for developing such systems.

Abstract: It has been shown that the potential for environmental, and financial improvements through the increased substitution of in-person meetings by virtual communication is considerable. However, it has also been shown that this potential is not automatically realized by investing in the technology that can enable virtual meetings. This paper describes two case studies that explored the factors that influenced communication and meeting behavior. A number of drivers and barriers for virtual meetings are identified, and, in addition, measures are proposed to improve the utilization of virtual tools for business communication.

Abstract: Rising waste levels in Canada necessitate renewed waste reduction efforts, with a focus on prevention. Extended Producer Responsibility is an important policy tool, which has the potential to impact materials management systems and drive pollution prevention efforts. This article contrasts the European approach to producer responsibility with “product stewardship” initiatives in Canada, highlighting British Columbia's experience with “full product stewardship”. Lessons from European and Canadian stewardship programs highlight the importance of designing EPR programs with clear legislation that encourages sustainable product design by delivering a full range of signals to producers. Recommendations are developed for advancing EPR in Canada.

Abstract: This paper proposes a novel measurement scheme of 3D shape similarity that integrates D2 Shape Descriptor and Negative Feature Decomposition (NFD). Using NFD, the scheme firstly converts a 3D mechanical part into a tree structure of geometrical primitives decomposed from the part model, namely Negative Feature Tree (NFT). The D2 shape descriptions of these primitives are then produced for further similarity assessments. We assess the shape similarity on a level-by-level basis between the NFTs of a query part and a candidate part. The weighted sum of the similarity values computed on each level is then used as a measure of the overall similarity between the two parts. Our approach combines the simplicity of D2 shape description while overcoming its insensitivity to negative features with NFD. It performs more consistently than the method of Convex Hull Difference (CHD). A comparison with the assessment results using D2 and CHD demonstrates the effectiveness of the new scheme.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper is concerned with the nature of the connection between services and manufacturing in manufacturing-oriented supply networks. The existing literature on manufacturing shifting into service is reviewed and, although such moves are seen as a way to increased revenue and profit, there are concerns that firms do not understand how the capabilities that underpin manufacturing may be extended to enable effective service delivery. Inspired by Chase's concept of the ‘service factory’, which sees the factory as a repository of knowledge and a platform for services, the paper applies Edith Penrose's conception of services as emanating from firms' resources to examine an advanced component manufacturing firm in the course of a number of service-oriented projects. This leads to a model of service development in manufacturing firms, consisting of a network trigger, an opportunity to change the ‘productive opportunity’, the ‘revelation’ of resources and Penrose-services, a reconfiguration of the network, leading to an expanded productive opportunity and hence a platform for marketing new service capabilities. In this sense a network is seen as an inter-connected set of productive opportunities. It also draws attention to the importance in theory and practice of understanding both the institutional and the ontological connection between service offerings and the products, factories, firms and networks with which they are associated.

Abstract: The information and communication technologies (ICTs) have a profound impact on economy and environment. The performance improvements in ICT leads to increased consumption of ICT products and services, which has numerous environmental implications on different levels.

The author points to the analogy between the rebound effects in the energy sector and the growth effects in ICT. A multilevel taxonomy of rebound effects is taken from the energy economics literature in order to structure the discussion on the environmental implications of increasing use of ICT products and applications. The author distinguishes two levels of environmental impacts from ICT: first, related to the life cycle of ICT hardware and second, related to the way the ICT applications are being used. By presenting examples from different literature, the paper illustrates the complexity of the environmental impacts and stresses the decisive role of human behaviour in determining their significance.

The issues presented in the paper are highly relevant to any decision-makers, who are placing large expectations on ICT and who needs to be aware about its potential environmental implications in the complex socioeconomic system of today. Huge investments are being made into the sector with large expectations for economic growth and environmental improvements, but neglecting the issue of rebound effect causes a risk of misallocation of funds. Having more information on effects and causes will allow decision-makers to optimise future development with a balance between economic growth and environmental quality.

Abstract: In this paper, different implementations of elastic joint models of industrial robots are described and compared established in ADAMS and SimMechanics. The models are intended to be used for path prediction under process force load due to Roboforming and high speed cutting, respectively. The computational results have been compared and showed good agreement. In experiments of robot forming and robot milling the measured and simulated path deviations according to the process force are compared. The experiments are descriped and the results are discussed within the paper as a basis of a next step model based compensation of the path deviation.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper addresses the link between action and cognition in markets. Increasing reliance on markets to co-ordinate economic activity across diverse contexts underscores the need to better understand how such coordination is achieved and how it can be changed. Our starting point is sense-making in formal organizations and markets. We argue that, whereas focusing on intersubjective agreements supported by frequent communication provides useful insights on coordination in formal organizations, coordination in markets cannot rely on these mechanisms alone. We borrow Thévenot's (1984) notions of form and investments in form to show how cognition and action are interrelated, and coordination achieved, in market settings. A form is characterized by its capacity to generate temporal and spatial equivalencies, allowing us to move from the particular (e.g., one exchange episode) to the generic (e.g., recurrent exchanges with particular types of customers). The development of a form helps construct common contexts of action which become the basis for coordinated actions.

Our empirical case describes how the introduction of Frequent Flyer Programs created a new market form following the US Airline Deregulation Act (1978). Under the previous regulatory regime, the US Civil Aeronautics Board controlled routes and prices and airlines were limited to competing on frequency and quality of service. We show how successive rounds of investments by a variety of market actors helped articulate and consolidate the new market form over a 10-year period. Whereas action preceded cognition in the early stages, the gradual consolidation of the new form provided opportunities for market participants to gain reflexive distance and conjure up further ways to engage with the form.

Abstract: Abstract
The paper provides a further verification of the Functional Products (FP) technical lifecycle and additional details regarding its four sub-lifecycles concerning: hardware, software, service-support system and management of operation. Outlined, in a novel way, is how the four sub-lifecycles may be embodied in order to manage and keep the FP technical lifecycle running at an agreed-upon level of availability. The FP technical lifecycle is further analyzed from the viewpoint of its supporting role to the FP economic lifecycle, as well as compliance, regulatory and commercial aspects.

Abstract: Over the next years, the ageing profile of the UK population will lead to a sharp increase in the volumes of pension annuity sales. Every individual that participates in a defined contribution occupational or a personal pension scheme is obliged to convert the capital accumulated into a regular post-retirement income by purchasing an annuity before the age of 75. To ensure a more competitive market the UK Financial Services Authority has ruled that from 1 September 2002 pensioners must be informed that they have the right to purchase their annuities from suppliers other than their current pension provider—this is termed exercising an open market option (OMO).

However, the complicated nature of pensions and annuities means the purchase of an annuity is highly dependent upon the information provided by the sellers of these products and the advice received. Given that OMO's are supposed to encourage purchasers to be able to access information on a whole range of annuities from the various suppliers in the market, a single web-based hub that linked manufacturers, distributors and existing industry portals seemed the obvious solution to the challenges facing the industry following the government legislation. However, while the industry recognised that a single product purchasing and servicing system would meet the data management needs of all its stakeholders and carry enormous potential to realise cost and business process efficiencies, the competitive nature of the industry and the slow decision making processes within the individual companies has meant that the project to build ‘The Annuity Exchange’ has suffered a number of setbacks and delays.

This article describes the business case for ‘The Annuity Exchange’, its objectives and design, and the technical/industry engagement issues it has faced.

Abstract: To extend new product development (NPD) research, this study proposes and tests a theory of complementarities between information technology (IT) implementation and customer orientation. In addition, this study provides a fine-grained analysis of associations between various aspects of customer orientation and time-to-market of new products. The data comes from 176 manufacturing companies in China. This study tests the hypotheses that three dimensions of customer orientation shorten time-to-market of new products, and IT implementation moderates the relationship between customer orientation and time-to-market of new products. Regression results indicate that (1) customer focus, customer involvement and communication with customers have significantly negative effects on time-to-market of new products; (2) IT implementation plays a role of complementary asset to customer involvement and communication with customers. We discuss the implications of the findings for a contingency theory of time-to-market reduction through customer orientation, for future research and for managerial practices.

Abstract: With the increase in the influence of service industry on the economy, more and more firms are becoming concern about service and service management. Unlike tangible products, since service is a delivery system, designing and controlling delivery process are important in management of services. One of the most important issues in managing service delivery process is how to find out and improve inefficient process in an organization. Once inefficient processes are found, it should be determined which process is to be improved first, since it is impossible for any firm to improve all of their inefficient processes simultaneously. Then, in order to get some ideas about improvement, selecting a benchmark process is required. The objective of this paper is to provide a systematic approach for benchmarking service process. We used the integrated form of data envelopment analysis (DEA) and decision tree (DT) as a benchmarking method instead of using DEA alone. Although DEA is a useful technique for benchmarking, it fails to give any clear directions as to which process should be improved first. The proposed approach enables firm’s manager to find inefficient service units in a firm-level and inefficient processes in a service unit-level. The proposed approach also allows the manager to select which process to improve first and which process a benchmark for referencing. As a result, it can be helpful for operating and managing firms’ processes. To show how useful the suggested service process benchmarking framework is, an illustrative example is addressed.

Abstract: Recommender systems provide personalized recommendations on products or services to customers. Collaborative filtering is a widely used method of providing recommendations using explicit ratings on items from users. In some e-commerce environments, however, it is difficult to collect explicit feedback data; only implicit feedback is available.

In this paper, we present a method of building an effective collaborative filtering-based recommender system for an e-commerce environment without explicit feedback data. Our method constructs pseudo rating data from the implicit feedback data. When building the pseudo rating matrix, we incorporate temporal information such as the user’s purchase time and the item’s launch time in order to increase recommendation accuracy.

Based on this method, we built both user-based and item-based collaborative filtering-based recommender systems for character images (wallpaper) in a mobile e-commerce environment and conducted a variety of experiments. Empirical results show our time-incorporated recommender system is significantly more accurate than a pure collaborative filtering system.

Abstract: This paper discusses the benefits and the weaknesses of the World Trade Organization (WTO) Agreement on Basic Telecommunications. The Agreement is aimed at opening national telecommunications services markets to foreign competitors as well as setting rules to ensure fair competition. Previous assessment of the Agreement raised three main shortcomings: the limited scope of liberalization created by the Agreement, the lack of precision of the regulatory principles of the Reference Paper and the weaknesses of the sectoral approach in comparison with a more horizontal approach to competition policy and domestic regulation. This paper challenges these views and emphasizes the importance of the Agreement and the Reference Paper on regulatory principles in particular.

Abstract: Abstract
Business models for open data have emerged in response to the economic opportunities presented by the increasing availability of open data. However, scholarly efforts providing elaborations, rigorous analysis and comparison of open data models are very limited. This could be partly attributed to the fact that most discussions on Open Data Business Models (ODBMs) are predominantly in the practice community. This shortcoming has resulted in a growing list of ODBMs which, on closer examination, are not clearly delineated and lack clear value orientation. This has made the understanding of value creation and exploitation mechanisms in existing open data businesses difficult and challenging to transfer. Following the Design Science Research (DSR) tradition, we developed a 6-Value (6-V) business model framework as a design artifact to facilitate the explication and detailed analysis of existing ODBMs in practice. Based on the results from the analysis, we identify business model patterns and emerging core value disciplines for open data businesses. Our results not only help streamline existing ODBMs and help in linking them to the overall business strategy, but could also guide governments in developing the required capabilities to support and sustain the business models.

Abstract: In order to pursue sustainability, commercial activities between the supply and demand sides must be somehow changed. In the context of eco-design, producers must need a much bigger framework than is available in current eco-design techniques. This calls for establishing a new discipline. This paper aims at proposing a novel engineering discipline for producers toward sustainable production and consumption, Service Engineering (SE). For the sake of this, the scheme of SE is first explained. Second, a methodology of modeling and designing services, and a computer-aided design tool called Service Explorer, are presented. Third, they are proved to be effective through two applications. In SE, positive and negative changes of consumers are modelled as value and cost, respectively. In addition, the model to describe a target consumer is provided for grounding the identified value. A design methodology including the identification of value with realization structures is also provided. Furthermore, SE allows designing services in parallel with products. In the application to service redesign of an existing hotel in Italy, it was demonstrated that the presented methods and tools facilitate designers adding new value like the view of outside through a window in energy-saving structure. It was also proven to deal with both products and services through generating a solution called “cash-back per non-wash” system for washing towels. The other smaller-scaled application to design of renting home appliances revealed that they support to determine a property of an adopted physical product like the size of a TV set depending on target customers’ properties effectively.

Abstract: Solar Home System (SHS) based rural electrification has experienced a considerable growth in Bangladesh since the start of the Rural Electrification and Renewable Energy Development Project (REREDP) in 2003. The initial target of 50,000 SHS installations in off-grid areas was achieved within 2.5 years, 3 years ahead of schedule. After achieving a revised target of 200,000 SHSs, ahead of schedule in early 2009, a new target of 1 million SHS installations by 2012 was set. The installation of about 0.5 million systems by March 2010 indicates that the current target may well be achieved before the deadline. The size of the SHS market and its impact on the regeneration of the rural economy make it necessary to investigate the quality and reliability of the installed SHSs, if the continued success of the initiative is to be maintained. This paper reports on the findings from a field-based technical appraisal of SHS installations in Bangladesh. Sixty geographically dispersed installation sites were visited. Physical characteristics of the SHSs and their system components were tested to ascertain compliance with and deviations from the approved specifications. Despite the overwhelming success of the REREDP project, the study revealed various shortcomings. Notable among these are: incompatible and sub-optimal component configurations, faulty installations and a lack of effective quality assurance mechanism. The findings are contextualized and the ways to address the identified shortcomings are discussed.

Abstract: AbstractObjectives
Japan's health system is proud of its excellent indicators, such as the highest life expectancy at a relative low cost compared to other OECD countries. Whereas two important foundations have been the universal insurance coverage and focus on preventive care, it is noteworthy that traditional medical systems (TRM) are also well integrated, representing an exceptional model of health system integration. This approach can provide interesting policy insights for other countries. The study critically examines the relevance and experience of integration of traditional medical methods in the Japanese health care system.
Methods
The study used methods like comprehensive literature review, as well as key informant interviews from various sectors of TRM. A qualitative analytical approach was used to classify and analyze the data.
Results
Inclusion of major formulations and therapies in national health insurance; introduction of industrial production methods; quality standardization; assuring of a good demand–supply balance for resources; systematic training of doctors, pharmacists and therapists have increased availability and access of traditional medical knowledge, products and services. High interest among physicians, practitioners and the public indicate an increasing demand. In the process of modernization a positivist approach is followed and limited elements have been integrated in the health system.
Conclusion
TRM products and services form only a small percentage of the overall Japanese healthcare system. Yet there is good awareness among doctors and general public on the relevance of traditional medicine. TRM has been well standardized and integrated. However TRM's potential is not yet fully explored and utilized.

Abstract: This paper models the growth rate and the saturation market penetration level for advanced traveler information system (ATIS) products/services with heterogeneous drivers. The price of using and the benefit gained from ATIS services are considered two key factors in explaining the growth of adoption of ATIS products. The information benefit is measured as the travel time saving between equipped and unequipped drivers and evaluated by a mixed stochastic and deterministic network equilibrium model. A modified logistic type growth model is adopted to describe the cumulative adoption of ATIS products over years. The final stationary equilibrium level of ATIS market penetration is so determined that the value of the information provided will decline to the point at which no new users will find it advantageous to purchase that service. The endogenous growth and stationary equilibrium model of market penetration of ATIS services is useful for forecasting the growth process and the impacts on the system performance of ATIS.

Abstract: Our strong dependence on fossil fuels results from the intensive use and consumption of petroleum derivatives which, combined with diminishing oil resources, causes environmental and political concerns. The utilization of agricultural residues as raw materials in a biorefinery is a promising alternative to fossil resources for production of energy carriers and chemicals, thus mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security. This paper focuses on a biorefinery concept which produces bioethanol, bioenergy and biochemicals from two types of agricultural residues, corn stover and wheat straw. These biorefinery systems are investigated using a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach, which takes into account all the input and output flows occurring along the production chain. This approach can be applied to almost all the other patterns that convert lignocellulosic residues into bioenergy and biochemicals. The analysis elaborates on land use change aspects, i.e. the effects of crop residue removal (like decrease in grain yields, change in soil N2O emissions and decrease of soil organic carbon). The biorefinery systems are compared with the respective fossil reference systems producing the same amount of products/services from fossils instead of biomass. Since climate change mitigation and energy security are the two most important driving forces for biorefinery development, the assessment focuses on greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and cumulative primary energy demand, but other environmental categories are evaluated as well.

Results show that the use of crop residues in a biorefinery saves GHG emissions and reduces fossil energy demand. For instance, GHG emissions are reduced by about 50% and more than 80% of non-renewable energy is saved. Land use change effects have a strong influence in the final GHG balance (about 50%), and their uncertainty is discussed in a sensitivity analysis. Concerning the investigation of the other impact categories, biorefinery systems have higher eutrophication potential than fossil reference systems. Based on these results, a residues-based biorefinery concept is able to solve two problems at the same time, namely find a use for the abundant lignocellulosic residues and ensure a mitigation effect for most of the environmental concerns related to the utilization of non-renewable energy resources.

Therefore, when agricultural residues are used as feedstocks, best management practices and harvest rates need to be carefully established. In fact, rotation, tillage, fertilization management, soil properties and climate can play an important role in the determination of the amount of crop residue that can be removed minimizing soil carbon losses.

Abstract: The market rarely delivers energy efficiency improvements spontaneously, as there is no market push. Consumers are not providing a pull towards energy efficiency, usually because they are ignorant of (or indifferent to) the range on the market, or the energy implications of their purchases. Whilst consumers are concerned about climate change and generally understand the causal role of fossil fuels, they believe either that they have done everything or that one person cannot make a difference. Without a positive design focus from manufacturers or a clear demand from consumers, no part of the market will deliver energy efficiency naturally: policy has to provide the drive. Within the UK, the opportunities to introduce policies based on higher energy prices are constrained by the impact these have on low-income households. This means that product policy (market transformation) has to be the main delivery mechanism for domestic energy efficiency in the UK. The policies adopted so far in the UK and EU have been successful, with existing products, but have not prevented the development of new, profligate equipment. This limited success demonstrates the need for European policy to be more forceful and for policy to involve engagement with manufacturers about the products they are planning to introduce. To motivate consumers, policy should focus on carbon and incorporate feedback. Without these developments, and considerably more activity by the European Commission and Member States, energy efficiency will not contribute its potential to the UK target of 60% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.

Abstract: In the last years, the industrial world has been increasingly adopting computer-aided solutions for design for maintainability and maintenance training tasks with the goal to reduce development costs and to shorten time, and to improve product and service quality. Computer-based training systems created to simulate machine assembly maintenance are normally operated by means of ordinary human–computer interfaces (keyboard, mouse, etc.), but this usually results in systems that are far from the real procedures, and therefore not effective in terms of training. In this study, we show that a better solution may come from the combination of virtual reality techniques and haptic interaction. To this regard, we present the results of a research aimed at testing and evaluating the effectiveness of the haptic feedback for first-person maintenance tasks targeted to the aerospace industry. The proposed system implements an interaction environment in which each of the main maintenance activities can be simulated by the trainee exploiting a hand-based commercial haptic device, operated by means of specific haptic-rendering techniques to provide realistic feedbacks during manipulation. A usability study is included to help assessing the potential of this approach.

Abstract: Abstract
With the Waste Framework Directive in 2008, waste prevention was promoted as the first priority. However, the actual implementation of waste prevention activities has so far been hesitant, and the focus on end-of-pipe waste management such as recycling prevails. The objective of this study is to explore key factors that influence engagement in waste prevention activities, thus helping to clarify why waste prevention, although adopted at both the European and national levels, has so far not been successfully implemented. We investigate the status quo, potentials of and barriers to waste prevention within local authorities in Germany and identify measures for waste prevention.

An extensive literature review emphasizes that the overall implementation status of waste prevention is low, which is partially due to an apparent lack of guidance for practitioners. Our empirical study investigates possible reasons and provides solution-oriented insights on how to encourage activity. The study is based on a survey simultaneously addressing 386 Bavarian municipalities by questionnaire and on personal interviews with 33 executives and employees of public administration from three different local authorities.

Results verify that the implementation status of waste prevention measures among local authorities is generally low. Only 10% of all cities are about to establish waste prevention as a criterion in public procurement. The estimation of waste prevention potentials varies depending on the waste stream. A total of 70% of all respondents evaluate the potential for waste prevention of typical recycling materials, such as paper and plastic, as high or very high, while waste from building materials and construction components is considered to be hardly preventable. Main barriers are the low acceptance for waste prevention activities and a lack of information. A total of 25% of all interview partners felt that environmental awareness in general is a mandatory condition for behavioral change.

Abstract: Abstract
The development of machine tools is driven by the requirements of the customers and by the action of the competitors. More and more customers demand energy efficient machine tools to lower their energy consumption and reduce their energy costs. Machine tool manufacturers respond to the requirements of the customers and offer machine tools with energy efficient components.

Besides optimizing technical components of machine tools, services can also increase the energy efficiency. This paper demonstrates that services not only raise the customer benefit but also offer a possibility to improve Key Performance Indicators regarding energy efficiency. It will be presented how services can improve the energy efficiency of a machine tool based on a case study of a machine tool manufacturer. First, the life cycle of a machine tool will be analyzed. Secondly, the energy efficiency will be assessed and services which increase the energy efficiency will be identified. Finally, impacts of the services on the energy efficiency of a machine tool will be evaluated.

Abstract: This paper presents a comparison analysis of eco-efficiency in the small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) of Venezuela. The research can be divided into three parts: the first part reviews similar studies in the literature on the level of eco-efficiency exhibited by the companies of Venezuela and other countries. In the second place, the findings of a survey conducted on Venezuelan SMEs allowed the definition of 54 eco-efficiency profiles. Thirdly, six national experts in cleaner production and eco-efficiency were interviewed. The interview was based on a questionnaire similar to that used in the survey of the Venezuelan SMEs. At a second meeting, the experts were asked to discuss on the similarities and differences between their answers and those of the company's managers.

The findings of the survey allow us to conclude that Venezuelan SMEs understand the legal environmental regulations that affect them but they do not perceive the influence of external driving forces like customers demand for green products or institutional incentives. The adoption of eco-efficiency practices is not perceived as an incentive to improve competitiveness so that the environmental strategies adopted generally aim at reducing costs or avoiding non-compliance sanctions and negative effects on the company image. Materials recycling and reuse, especially packaging materials, are common practices; however, other environmental tools or practices have not been implemented yet, e.g. environmental management systems (EMS), process, product and services design tools based on the product life cycle, renewable energy resources or green marketing. There are also differences among the eight industrial sectors analyzed, food and chemical industries having the higher index of eco-efficiency practices, and plastic and wood industries the lower.

Abstract: The wine industry has developed greatly over recent years, and it could be stated that what was once a traditional industry has become a very productive and technical sector. One aspect that has not been studied until now is the cork stopper, despite the fact that most wine bottles are sealed with this product, and practically all corks are produced in the Iberian Peninsula.

This study presents the environmental analysis of the production of natural cork stoppers, using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology. The research was supported by data from four Catalan representative companies and all the stages involved in the production after the forest management have been taken into account. The purpose of this research was to provide reference data for the Catalan cork industrial sector (Northeast Spain), and also contribute to deciding which aspects of natural cork stopper production must be improved and further researched. Another objective of this research was to emphasise and demonstrate that LCA methodology could be an interesting tool for improving traditional industry, from a cleaner production perspective.

Results could be used by other sector companies to analyse and compare themselves with in order to know if they could improve their production with the current available technology. Impact assessment results indicate that the manufacturing stage was the stage causing the greatest impact, but also an evaluation of the influence of the initial transport from the forest reveals that this stage could notably increase the impact when raw cork was moved from distant forests.

Abstract: Since the advent of the embryonic model almost a century ago, R&amp;D systems have gone through an evolutionary process of development that can be classified into three generations. Today, the fourth generation of R&amp;D is emerging that emphasizes both strategic and operational importance of knowledge management (KM). Despite the importance of KM, the network between conceptual scheme of the fourth generation R&amp;D and practical system of KM remains a missing link. In response, the main objective of this paper is to present a framework for designing and implementing knowledge management system (KMS) for the fourth generation R&amp;D. The proposed system is named KNOWVATION, which combines the notions of knowledge and innovation. First, the evolutionary classification of the R&amp;D generations and the corresponding characteristics of the respective generations are defined. Second, the organizational structure and knowledge functions of the fourth generation R&amp;D are derived. Finally, the overall design framework and detailed sub-modules are presented.

Abstract: Abstract
IBM is an iconic corporation, whose history of innovation and growth has been told many times in many ways. In this short retelling, the focus is from the perspective of service and service growth. In the early 1990s, during what was arguably IBM's darkest days, it was a return to service and service growth that saved IBM and dramatically grew the IT services industry. This paper shares some personal reflections on the history of IBM from a service perspective, and advocates for more service research to advance our understanding of service systems and service growth.

The paper proposes a Functional Products (FP) lifecycle viewed from economic, ecologic and societal perspectives. The overall FP lifecycle is further discussed from the viewpoint of its technical and economic lifecycles. The paper suggests that the overall FP lifecycle is governed by a sustainable win-win situation between the provider and customer sides, and thus that there needs to be a balance regarding the perceived value for both parties.

Abstract: Abstract
The increasing responsibility of companies for sustainable manufacturing of their products requires a resource-efficient use of a machine tool. Aside from technical measures regarding the machines, life cycle oriented services present a high potential for improving resource efficiency. In order to exploit these potentials systematically, a method to identify and to analyze impacts of services on the resource efficiency of a machine tool is required.

In this paper, existing approaches for increasing the resource efficiency of a machine tool are analyzed. Then a framework is presented that enables manufacturers of machine tools to improve the resource efficiency of their machines with different services.

Abstract: Abstract
Among the activities managed by an organization, the maintenance of the resources it uses considerably affects sustainable performance. In this paper, we propose research on decision support for controlling sustainable performance induced by maintenance processes based on the core principles of decision systems. We discuss their application in maintenance, and underline the weaknesses of current practices in this domain. As we are particularly interested in key performance indicators, dashboards and prognosis approaches, we have reviewed the work on these subjects conducted by different scientific communities. This study allows us to propose a set of founding elements to conduct research on dashboards for sustainable performance in maintenance. Among these elements, we define sustainable value, sustainable signature, and sustainable state of the equipment. We suggest implementing such dashboards in Sustainable Condition-Based Maintenance (SCBM) based on Remaining Sustainable Life (RSL), and we propose a framework to conduct this research using a systemic approach according to the process of dashboard building.

Abstract: In applications of interactive case-based reasoning (CBR) such as help-desk support and recommender systems, a problem that often affects retrieval performance is the inability to distinguish between cases that have different solutions. For example, it is not unusual in recommender systems for two distinct products or services to have the same values for all attributes in the case library. While it is unlikely that both solutions are equally suited to the user's requirements, the system cannot help the user to choose between them. This problem, which we refer to as inseparability, can also arise as a result of incomplete data in the target problem presented for solution by a CBR system. We present an in-depth analysis of the inseparability problem, its relationship to the problem of incomplete data, and its impact on retrieval performance.

Abstract: Abstract
In the field of design, it is accepted that users’ perceptions of systems are influenced by emotion as much as cognition, and functionally-complete products will not be adopted if they do not appeal to emotions. While software engineering methodologies have matured to handle non-functional requirements such as usability, what has not been investigated fully is the emotional needs of people. That is, what do users want to feel, and how do they feel about a system? In this paper, we argue that these emotional desires should be treated as first-class citizens in software engineering methodology, and present preliminary work on including emotions in requirements models using emotional goals. We evaluate these models both with a controlled user study, and on a case study of emergency systems for older people. The results of the controlled user study indicate that people are comfortable interpreting and modifying our models, and view the inclusion of emotions as first-class entities as a positive step in software engineering. The results of our case study indicate that current emergency systems fail to address the emotional needs their users, leading to low adoption and low usage. We conceptualised, designed, and prototyped an improved emergency system, and placed it into the homes of nine older people over a period of approximately two weeks each, showing improved user satisfaction over existing systems.

Abstract: In order to maintain the economies of large-volume work that help reduce construction costs, homebuilders in Mexico tend to mass produce low-cost housing using conventional methods and targeting low- and middle-income earners before having buyers for the units. Even though these homes respect a minimum of housing quality as defined by housing institutions such as governmental bodies providing financial assistance via loans provision, homebuyers appear dissatisfied with these ready-built shelters that barely meet their housing requirements.

In order to identify today’s market demand for new homes in Mexico, the authors surveyed some typical low-cost housing developments located in Aguascalientes—a middle-sized city located in the central part of the country. The authors visited construction sites and conducted personal interviews with selected homeowners. Based on their observation of such housing developments, the authors found that many homebuyers ‘extensively’ modify their new home immediately after occupancy. This need to personalise their new house may be explained in part by the lack of customisability in housing design at the purchase stage.

This study therefore sought to introduce a ‘mass custom design’ approach that may bridge the production gap between the need for the mass production of housing that helps lower selling prices and the need for the design customisation required by today's consumer. This paper also examines the potential effects of this new design approach on the delivery of conventional, low-cost housing in Mexico.

Abstract: Existing term extraction systems have predominantly targeted large and well-written document collections, which provide reliable statistical and linguistic evidence to support term extraction. In this article, we address the term extraction challenges posed by sparse, ungrammatical texts with domain-specific contents, such as customer complaint emails and engineers’ repair notes. To this aim, we present ExtTerm, a novel term extraction system. Specifically, as our core innovations, we accurately detect rare (low frequency) terms, overcoming the issue of data sparsity. These rare terms may denote critical events, but they are often missed by extant TE systems. ExtTerm also precisely detects multi-word terms of arbitrarily lengths, e.g. with more than 2 words. This is achieved by exploiting fundamental theoretical notions underlying term formation, and by developing a technique to compute the collocation strength between any number of words. Thus, we address the limitation of existing TE systems, which are primarily designed to identify terms with 2 words. Furthermore, we show that open-domain (general) resources, such as Wikipedia, can be exploited to support domain-specific term extraction. Thus, they can be used to compensate for the unavailability of domain-specific knowledge resources. Our experimental evaluations reveal that ExtTerm outperforms a state-of-the-art baseline in extracting terms from a domain-specific, sparse and ungrammatical real-life text collection.

Abstract: Champagne cork stoppers are a product made basically from cork, a natural and renewable resource extracted from cork oak forests in western Mediterranean regions. Each stopper is made up of an agglomerated cork body and two natural cork discs. In 2009, 60% of the world’s champagne cork stoppers were produced in Catalonia, due to the importance of cava, champagne and other sparkling wines in neighbouring areas. The aim of this research was to provide environmental reference data on champagne cork stoppers production, and identify the industrial stages and operations that made the greatest impact. This research was carried out using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology, and five of the most representative producers were analysed. The system considered all the processes involved in production after the forest management stage and one million champagne cork stoppers were taken as a functional unit (FU).

Results showed that 53,886 kg of CO2 eq. were emitted to produce the FU. It was observed that the champagne cork stopper manufacture stage represented between 57 and 67% of the environmental impact, depending on the category. Specifically, between 25 and 47% of the environmental impacts associated with this stage were caused by the body agglomeration operation, and between 21 and 29% were caused by the gluing of discs. On the other hand, some of the production stages such as the transport of raw cork and intermediate products, cork slab preparation or end of life stages represented a very small part of the total environmental impact of the product, less than 2%. Furthermore, it was observed that a champagne cork stopper produced by the most impacting company presented a higher impact, between 10 and 27% above the sector average, depending on the impact category; while the least impacting company presented between 12 and 32% less impact. These differences indicate that some companies can improve their production by adopting technology and production practices that some of their competitors have already put in place.

Abstract: A base of clearly defined product information is a key foundation for an e-commerce system. The manipulation and exchange of semantically enriched and precise product information can enhance the quality of an e-commerce system and offer a high level of interoperability with other systems. Product information consists of product attributes and the relationships between products. Product categorization (or classification) is one type of such relationships. Ontology can play an important role in the formalization of product information. Although the idea of utilizing ontology for e-Catalogs has been raised before, we are yet to find an operational implementation of applying ontology in the domain. In this paper, we report on our recent effort to build an operational product ontology system for a government procurement service. The system is designed to serve as a product ontology knowledge base; not only for the design and construction of product databases but also for search and discovery of products. Especially, the keyword-based searching over product ontology database demands different techniques from those over conventional document databases or relational databases, and should be designed to reflect particular characteristics of product ontology. We also introduce some other issues that we have experienced in the project, and those issues include product ontology modeling, ontology construction and maintenance, and visualization.

Abstract: Abstract
This study examines the effect of disclosure regulation on earnings management using Taiwanese companies conducting transactions with China as the institutional setting. Measuring earnings management by the amount of discretionary accruals (DACCs), the study shows that disclosure regulation mitigates DACCs of Taiwanese firms engaging in related-party transactions with Chinese entities. Following enactment of the disclosure regulation in November 2000, DACCs among Taiwanese enterprises conducting transactions via offshore affiliates dropped. While the disclosure regulation helps to reduce earnings management, this study reports that such effect is asymmetric between high-tech firms and non–high-tech firms. Specifically, the disclosure regulation is effective in reducing earnings management among firms in non–high-tech sectors. However, such effect is not significant among firms in high-tech sectors. This study discusses the implications of empirical findings for corporate management, regulatory agencies, and firm stakeholders.

Abstract: Abstract
The EU regulations on energy saving have been implemented in Italy with the adoption of the North-European super-insulated model that led to the construction of buildings not much related to their climatic context. The European Directives 2010/31/EU and 2012/27/EU highlighted the importance to consider the specific climate but the development of a technical culture suitable for a temperate climate still remains an open question.

The aim of the paper is to quantify the effect on energy consumptions, comfort levels, environmental sustainability of the adoption of 3 energy efficient envelopes recently introduced in Mediterranean area and characterized by different thermal inertia (masonry, wood–cement, wood). In order to achieve this goal, a multidisciplinary approach was adopted involving: the study of the energy performance in winter and summer using analytical models both in semi-stationary and dynamic conditions (Termo and EnergyPlus programs) and the detailed analysis of thermal bridges (Therm software); the analysis of the annual comfort through dynamic analysis with Fanger’s PMV and adaptive comfort models; the quantification of environmental–economic impacts through LCA analysis (SimaPro software) with Eco-indicator 99, CED, EPS 2000 and IPCC 2001 GWP methods and LCC considering financial and environmental costs.

The results made it possible to stress the differences between the various adopted methods and demonstrate that in such energy efficient envelopes the thermal mass has low influence on energy saving while it has a great effect on comfort levels and environmental burdens, with a conflicting incidence on these two aspects.

Abstract: Abstract
Agility in the sense of changeability on the manufacturing network level, and here especially the business perspective, has received less attention than the other dimensions of changeability on the lower production levels, as well as in relation to the technological perspective. The present paper aims to enrich the concept of agility in the aforementioned sense, taking strategic management concepts into account that have so far received less attention in relation to changeability. Namely, we consider the concepts of lead factory, capacity pooling and allying, operational flexibility, and the concept of combining products, services and software as fruitful enrichments of the umbrella concept changeability. In so doing, we highlight interdependencies between agility and the analyzed concepts as well as the other changeability dimensions on the lower production level of factories or sites. On this basis, we formulate six hypotheses in consideration of the presented theoretical derivations. Hence, the methodological approach of our research is conceptual and hypothesis generating. Our work is supposed to build the basis for continuative conceptual and empirical research on agility.

Abstract: Abstract
With Australasian countries/regions included within the umbrella of Asia for the purpose of this study, we examine all papers having authorship from Asia published in a set of journals generally recognized as the most relevant leading journals in the field of OM and map the leadership role of Asian authors, institutions, and countries/regions. We examine leadership within the dominant areas of OM research in Asia and chart the patterns of growth in research from Asia over the years 2001–2015. The results show that the Asian countries/regions of China, Hong Kong, Australia, Singapore, and South Korea account for a major portion of the papers having authorship from Asia. We find a number of authors and institutions from these leading Asian countries/regions ranking high on various network centrality measures and serving as hubs of connectivity and productivity in research. Asian OM research is found to be focused most on the areas of supply chain management, quality management, and manufacturing. Our examination reveals a trend of rapid increase in the number of papers with Asian authorship appearing in these journals and countries/regions of the Asia Pacific gaining prominence in the global OM research domain. We identify and discuss country and regional focus in OM research from Asia, emerging trends, and future research opportunities.

Abstract: Commoditization erodes the competitive differentiation of companies and often leads to a profit squeeze. Existing literature recommends the transition from basic product offerings to service-based value concepts in order to regain competitiveness in such a context. This paper explores the concrete efforts of suppliers in the commoditized electro-technical industry to create new non-price-based customer value. In this paper, a taxonomy of efforts is developed which builds on the competitive strategy and strategic marketing literature. Our research identifies barriers to the market introduction of these new value concepts. Observations in this industry lead to a framework that (1) proposes alternative step-by-step strategies for making the transition from basic products to service-based solutions, and (2) offers alignment suggestions for overcoming identified barriers. Migration paths to introducing new service-based value concepts are incremental rather than radical, and managers should complement their market approach with (a) value chain actions to create multilevel industry support and (b) an organizational alignment approach.

Abstract: Nowadays the competition among companies, joined to the environmental protection rules, is so compelling that they should not only be on the top of technology in they area, but also run their business according to life-long models. The emphasis on the product post-sale life is common for these models. The most popular model is product lifecycle management (PLM), for manufacturing companies, or service engineering (SE), for service-oriented companies, and, for both, common paradigms are in maintenance, with conformance-to-use certification. This paper introduces basic research results achieved in application of Ambient Intelligence (AmI), and suggests considering maintenance as a cross section of the two business paradigms.

Abstract: The Earth System Science Partnership (ESSP) was established in 2001 by four global environmental change (GEC) research programmes: DIVERSITAS, IGBP, IHDP and WCRP. ESSP facilitates the study of the Earth's environment as an integrated system in order to understand how and why it is changing, and to explore the implications of these changes for global and regional sustainability. Joint research projects on carbon dynamics, food, water and health have been established. As a result of an independent review, the ESSP developed a new strategy that will provide an internationally coordinated and holistic approach to Earth system science. The approach integrates natural and social sciences from regional to the global scale. The mainstay of the ESSP is to identify and define Earth system science challenges, enable integrative research to address these challenges, and build scientific capacity. The GEC research community also faces an increasing challenge to present research results in more accessible and informative ways to stakeholders, especially to policy-makers. In response, the ESSP is developing new services that include knowledge products, Earth system science fora, a synthesis journal and interdisciplinary collaborative research. Coping with GEC is an enormous challenge and one the world must respond to successfully. Our common goal is, therefore, to develop the essential knowledge base needed to respond effectively and quickly to the great challenge of GEC.

Abstract: The role of the disturbance waves for transferring liquid toward the top of a horizontal tube wall to cope with the drainage due to gravity is investigated by the direct numerical simulation (DNS) which is based on the continuity equation and the Navier–Stokes equations in three-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system. The level set method is used for capturing the interface between gas–liquid two fluids. Developing flow from a separated to an annular flow is simulated by using this numerical technique, and the liquid film formation is reproduced. It is demonstrated by this calculation result that liquid is transferred in the circumferential direction as the liquid film by the pumping action of disturbance waves which has been proposed by one of the present authors. That is, the pressure gradient formed within a disturbance wave in the circumferential direction plays an important role for the liquid film formation in a horizontal annular flow.

Abstract: Abstract
An information transition gap still exists between cleaner production and sustainable consumption. Governments and organizations should take responsibility for making adequate product-level sustainability information available for consumers. This study proposes a set of product-level sustainability attributes that captures influencing factors to facilitate sustainable consumption behavior and plays the role of facilitator in the Attitude-Facilitator-Infrastructure (AFI) framework. The survey method is adopted to gain insights from experts who work in the academic research field and practitioners, and an expert evaluation exercise is used to evaluate the importance and applicability of the attributes. The data received from surveys strongly suggest that consumers are increasingly concerned about the social impact of a product in its production phase and require more related information. From the perspective of experts, “Employees' Working Safety” is becoming an important attribute, but it is very difficult to evaluate. This research could serve as a fundamental study for developing related public or industrial policies, and it contributes to the field of developing an information transition approach from cleaner production to sustainable consumption.

Abstract: To deliver quality architecture to the vast majority of people, the building industry should move to full industrialization. Industrialization is basically the aggregation of a large market to divide into fractions the investment in strategies and technologies capable, in return, of simplifying the production and therefore reducing the costs. Simplification is the goal. Whereas the first four degrees of industrialization (i.e., prefabrication, mechanization, automation, robotics) remain at the level of duplicating the traditional construction processes, the fifth degree, reproduction, seeks innovative processes capable of short-cutting the repetitive linear operations of craftsmanship nature. A methodology can be extrapolated from the analogical model of printing (from the electronic printed circuit to the printed plumbing core). Adopting this methodology implies three steps: (i) generating the geometry of the product from the performance criteria; (ii) selecting a process that can simplify the materialisation; and (iii) designing the product accordingly. The load-bearing service core offers a relevant case study of that methodology: the space is distributed between the served and serving areas, the latter being concentrated into a value-added factory-made module capable of generating diversified building types.

Abstract: Abstract
The concepts of sustainability and innovation represent a fundamental conflict of objectives. This fact may help explain why the management literature has been ambiguous in its approach to sustainability-oriented innovation. The main purpose of this article is to develop an analytical framework to further study the influence of mindfulness. Mindfulness can support the development of the cognitive abilities, attitudes and behaviors of individuals who work within organizations. It can help them identify and utilize creative solutions that can lead to sustainability-oriented innovation. This paper presents a theoretical study that has been designed to support future research in sustainability-oriented innovation in the organizational context. A systematic literature review provides empirical evidence that mindfulness training can promote changes in individual cognition mechanisms that favor creativity and ecological concerns. As an isolated training technique, mindfulness can be used as a tool to reduce the stress that is caused by efficiency-driven business models. To help influence management actions in favor of sustainability-oriented innovation, this paper offers a research agenda that combines the following five fields of study: sufficiency-driven business models, inclusive capitalism, sustainability-oriented innovation capability, mindfulness in organizations and interdisciplinary and qualitative mindfulness.

Abstract: Abstract
We investigate the inter-market return and volatility linkages for an atypical case of firms with foreign IPOs that subsequently cross-listed in their domestic market. In particular, our data set consists of a unique sample of 29 Israeli firms that went public in the US (host market) and then cross-listed in the Israeli market (home market). To estimate the spillover effects, we employ bivariate GARCH models, assuming both constant and dynamic conditional correlation specifications. At the aggregate market level, we find unidirectional mean and volatility spillovers from the US to the Israeli market. For the portfolios of Israeli cross-listed stocks, we report significant spillovers, at both the mean and volatility levels, from the underlying stocks in the Israeli market to their American Depository Receipts (ADRs) but not vice versa. Thus, the home market dominates the host market in the price discovery process in this atypical international cross-listing case, providing new evidence in support of the home bias hypothesis. We also find that external shocks originating from the Middle East peace process have no impact on the conditional correlation between the two markets but external shocks originating from the world and regional markets impact the conditional correlation positively.

Abstract: Abstract
Developing products with improved environmental performance is regarded as a crucial component of companies' commitment towards sustainable development. The potential benefits derived from ecodesign are constantly highlighted in the literature, and go beyond the pure environmental dimension. However, the primary focus has been positioned on evaluating those benefits in terms of product-related environmental performance, which leaves an open potential for capturing performance from a broader managerial perspective. Consequently, the major challenges tackled by this paper relate to the limited focus on process-oriented perspectives that cover all dimensions of the triple bottom line and offer a systematized view on ecodesign performance measurement. Therefore, this paper presents a comprehensive set of process-related key performance indicators for product development, based on a three-step systematic literature review, followed by systematization of indicators and a critical analysis. A total of 787 indicators were identified and classified according to the sustainability dimensions, product development phases and units of measurement. The results point to a relevant asymmetry in the number of indicators proposed for each sustainability dimension, with large dominance of economic indicators. A critical analysis is presented and discussed in terms of the main organizational functions addressed, emphasizing a potential growth trend towards multi-dimensional indicators in recent years. The paper indicates that product development performance is still being mainly discussed in terms of product physical characteristics, along with a broad assortment of topics - from very specific document-related measures to high-level strategic dimensions - without focusing on environmental aspects, which is mainly due to the intangible and uncertain nature of product development processes.

Abstract: In multivariate statistical process control (MSPC), most multivariate quality control charts are shown to be effective in detecting out-of-control signals based upon an overall statistic. But these charts do not relieve the need for pinpointing source(s) of the out-of-control signals. Neural networks (NNs) have excellent noise tolerance and high pattern identification capability in real time, which have been applied successfully in MSPC. This study proposed a selective NN ensemble approach DPSOEN, where several selected NNs are jointly used to classify source(s) of out-of-control signals in multivariate processes. The immediate location of the abnormal source(s) can greatly narrow down the set of possible assignable causes, facilitating rapid analysis and corrective action by quality operators. The performance of DPSOEN is analyzed in multivariate processes. It shows improved generalization performance that outperforms those of single NNs and Ensemble All approach. The investigation proposed a heuristic approach for applying the DPSOEN-based model as an effective and useful tool to identify abnormal source(s) in bivariate statistical process control (SPC) with potential application for MSPC in general.

Abstract: Abstract
Human activities are now so pervasive and profound that they are altering the stability of the earth in ways that threaten the very life support system upon which humanity depends. The field of design has contributed to the creation of such complex socio-ecological problems, but it is also adapting as a source for solutions. Design Thinking (DT) was identified as a possible approach that could help create such solutions, and contribute to Strategic Sustainable Development (SSD). The purpose of the research was to examine potential contributors and hindrances of the DT process with regards to SSD, and create a prototype of an integrated process that could help achieve more strategic and sustainable outcomes. Using the Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) as a lens to examine and inform the above, combined with interviews, Action Research and expert feedback, an integrated process was created. It was indicated by participants of the Action Research and by experts that the proposed prototype could help reach strategic and sustainable outcomes, and that further refinement should be pursued. Consequently, a third and final prototype, suggesting a possible Sustainable Design Thinking (SDT) process, was developed.

Abstract: Abstract
Reliable provision of water, energy and transportation, all supplied through infrastructure, is necessary for the most basic human and economic development to occur. Such development however, is not enabled by specific end-use products (e.g. litres of water, kWh of electricity, litres of diesel and petrol), or by infrastructure itself (i.e. the systems of energy, transport, digital information, water, waste and flood protection assets), but rather through the infrastructure end-use services (e.g. hygiene, thermal comfort, communication, or accessibility).

The present form of infrastructure operation consists of supply systems provisioning unconstrained demand of end-use products, with larger consumption volumes corresponding to higher economic revenue. Providing infrastructure capacity to meet unmanaged growing demand is ultimately unsustainable, both in environmental and economic terms. Past research has focused on physical infrastructure assets on the one hand, and sustainable consumption and production on the other, often neglecting infrastructure end-use services. An important priority for sustainable infrastructure operation is therefore to analyse the infrastructure end-use service demands, and the variety of end-users’ wants and behaviours.

This paper outlines the key aspects of an end-user and service-centred approach to infrastructure operation. It starts with an overview of relevant research areas and literature. It then describes the infrastructure end-use services provided by different infrastructure streams quantitatively, with the UK domestic sector as an illustration. Subsequently, insights into infrastructure integration at the end-user level are presented. Finally, the infrastructure end-use service perspective is described as a holistic framework for intervention: understanding technological changes in context, acting directly on end-use demand, and including social implications of service-based solutions.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper examines the impact of stakeholder governance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) to determine whether CSR is employed as a mechanism to mitigate conflicts of interest between managers and diverse stakeholders, or used as managerial perquisites. To examine this relation properly, we not only employ an extensive sample of international firms, but also mitigate endogeneity by using various econometric methods. We find that stakeholder governance positively influences firms' CSR engagement with a greater magnitude than board governance after controlling for confounding factors. Stakeholders' influence in CSR engagement is more pronounced when investor protections and board governance are relatively weak.

Abstract: This paper aims to examine how firms are organizing to provide integrated solutions: a business model for the supply of capital goods based on the provision of products and services as integrated solutions to individual customer's needs. The industrial marketing literature suggests that the origins of this business model can be traced back to early 1960s when firms adopted strategies and organizations for ‘systems selling’. The marketing literature helps us to identify two contrasting types of organizations: (1) the vertically-integrated systems seller that produces all the product and service components in a system; and (2) the systems integrator that coordinates integration of components supplied by external firms. The paper uses these two ideal types to analyse the strategies and organizations of five case study firms that have recently attempted to move into the provision of integrated solutions. It argues that there is no evidence to support the continuing dominance of the systems seller or a simple transition from systems selling to systems integration. A more complex pattern of organizational forms is emerging, combining elements of both systems selling (i.e. vertical integration into services) and systems integration.

Abstract: This paper reports on a historical perspective of the evaluation studies present in software testing research published in the Brazilian Symposium on Software Engineering (SBES) in comparison to the International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE). The survey characterizes the software testing-related papers published in the 25-year history of SBES, investigates the types of evaluation presented in these publications, and how the rate of evaluations has evolved over the years. A similar analysis within the same period is made for ICSE, allowing for a comparison between the national and international scenario. Results show that the rate of papers that present evaluation studies in SBES has significantly increased over the years. However, among the papers that described some kind of evaluation, only around 20% performed more rigorous evaluations (i.e. case studies, quasi experiments, or controlled experiments). Such percentage is low when compared to ICSE, which presented 40% of papers with more rigorous evaluations within the same period. Nevertheless, we noticed that both venues still lack the publication of research reporting controlled experiments: only a single paper in each conference presented this type of evaluation.

Abstract: Abstract
Selecting a river rehabilitation project is a complex decision which should address social, economic and landscape indicators. The rehabilitation project becomes even more complicated if the city qualifies for inscription on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Tangible and intangible factors must be assessed to take into account cultural and natural heritage, water flow, river naturalization, interaction of water stream, construction costs and operational and maintenance costs. The proposed method is a hybrid model combining Delphi, Analytical Hierarchy Process and VIKOR technique. This hybrid model has been applied to the historic walled town of Cuenca and the Huecar river. The objective of the selected rehabilitation project must be the optimal integration of the river in the townscape. The indicators most valued by the panelists have been cultural heritage and river naturalization with 28% and 25% respectively. As a result, the trapezoidal cross section has achieved an acceptable advantage and stability over the modified triangular cross section, valued as second.

Abstract: Objectives:To describe clinical home care services provided by Canadian pharmacists and to identify facilitators of and barriers to the provision of these services.Design: Home care practices in Canada were identified using key informant and snowball sampling methods. Case descriptions of each pharmacy were composed using data obtained via a faxed questionnaire and a follow-up telephone interview.Setting: Community and institutional pharmacies across Canada. Participants: Sixteen pharmacists with practices that met three criteria: at least one home visit conducted per week, visits conducted specifically for clinical purposes beyond routine prescription counseling, and documentation of home care services.Intervention: Faxed questionnaire and follow-up telephone interview.Main Outcome Measures: Pharmacist characteristics, pharmacy characteristics, types of clinical home care services, home care-related products and dispensing services, referral system, reimbursement, barriers and facilitators, and evaluative strategies.Results: Twelve practices were in community pharmacies, nine of them independents. Home care services were provided primarily to address noncompliance and at the request of other health professionals. Elderly patients were the predominant service recipients. Services provided in most practices included compliance support, medication regimen review, monitoring of new medications, and patient education and training. Less than one-third of practices compiled evaluative data on these services. Most practices did not bill for services rendered. Lack of reimbursement was cited as the most important practice barrier, and having other sources of funding, such as high prescription revenues, was viewed as the major facilitator.Conclusion: Clinical home care practice is rare in Canadian pharmacy; reimbursement is a major barrier. Practices described in these case studies were initiated to address a perceived important patient need. To enable further dissemination of clinical home care practice, pharmacists need to establish formal linkages with other home care providers, evaluate their services, and use the data obtained to develop marketing and reimbursement strategies.

Abstract: Abstract
To ensure the sustainable production and consumption of biofuels, an increasing body of scientific literature has become available in recent years focusing on the environmental impacts of biofuels. Whilst the climate change mitigation is perhaps the primary driver behind the promotion of biofuels, climate change is not the only crucial impact associated with biofuel production and consumption systems. This study aims at analysing the extent of the dominant focus on climate impacts in Swedish research applying environmental systems analysis (ESA) tools to investigate the environmental impacts of biofuels, and why this may exist. A systematic literature review of Swedish research applying ESA tools in the study of transportation biofuels between 2000 and 2015 was conducted; identifying 64 studies. The results indicate that studies using life cycle assessment include a range of impact categories in addition to climate impacts, e.g. acidification and eutrophication. However, when also considering environmental footprints (i.e., carbon and water footprints) and material flow analyses, the dominance of carbon footprints leads to an overly dominant focus on climate impacts at the expense of other impact categories. The consideration of environmental impacts other than those related to climate impacts is discussed in terms of the influence of the dominant science-policy framework in Sweden and study dependent variables, such as data uncertainty and methodological limitations. Whilst biofuel production is inextricably linked to climate policy, the environmental impacts of Swedish biofuel production and consumption should also consider the broader context of the Swedish National Environmental Objectives.

Abstract: A two-indenture maintenance system is considered for a number of identical installations, in use at a single site. The installations are considered as assemblies that are made up of a number of repairable components. A component repair center and an assembly facility are both modeled as product form queuing networks. Failures of the assemblies occur according to a Poisson process. There are stock points for both ready-for-use assemblies and components. The inventory control policy employed at each stock point is a base-stock policy. Upon failure of an assembly, it is replaced by a ready-for-use one, if available. The failed assembly is inspected to identify and disassemble the broken component causing its failure. Next, the broken component is sent to the component repair center and one ready-for-use component is requested from the stock of this component. Once a ready-for-use component is available for the assembly, the request and the available component are merged and sent to the assembly facility. Completion of a component repair or an assembly operation results in a replenishment of the corresponding stock point. Requests that cannot be satisfied right away are backordered. Service discipline is first-come-first-serve at each facility. Assuming that only one component is identified at a time as the cause of an assembly failure, first an alternative slightly aggregated (but exact) formulation is given for the system and then a near-product-form solution is proposed as an approximate steady-state distribution of the aggregated system. Comparison of the approximate performance measures computed with the use of the near-product-form solution and the ones obtained with simulation shows that the approximation is quite accurate. Relying on the accuracy, approximate performance measures are used for optimizing base-stock levels with a greedy procedure.

Abstract: Managers in the service sector are under pressure to demonstrate that their services are customer-focused and that continuous performance improvement is being delivered. It is essential that customer expectations are properly understood and measured under the constraints that organizations must manage. The majority of the work to date has attempted to use the SERVQUAL (service quality) methodology in an effort to measure service quality. In this study, firstly the concept and factors of service quality are examined. Then a fuzzy AHP (analytic hierarchy process) is structured to evaluate the proposed service quality framework. A case study in healthcare sector in Turkey is presented to clarify the methodology.

Abstract: Abstract
System innovation for sustainability requires innovation in corporate governance. Social, ecological, economic, territorial and governance dimensions of sustainability are explored and a set of sustainability principles are integrated into a governance maturity grid. This grid enables both the assessment and the improvement of current strategic and operational practices regarding sustainability. It has been implemented in two industrial companies. As a result, it promotes senior management's reflection on their current strategies regarding value creation systems, and supports them in the definition of their sustainable strategies and the means of achieving them. This study is designed for businesses and presents a tool under development to support organizational innovation for system sustainability.

Abstract: Rapid prototyping and manufacturing (RP&amp;M) technique has shown a high potential to reduce the cycle and cost of product development, and has been considered as one of crucial enabling tools in digital manufacturing to effectively aid rapid product development. Manufacturing industry is evolving toward digitalization, network and globalization. The Internet, incorporating computers and multimedia, has provided tremendous potential for remote integration and collaboration in business and manufacturing applications. RP&amp;M technique using the Internet can further enhance the design and manufacturing productivity, speed, and economy, as well as share the RP machines. Web-based RP&amp;M systems have been developed and employed to implement remote service and manufacturing for rapid prototyping, enhance the availability of RP&amp;M facilities and improve the capability of rapid product development for a large number of small and medium sized enterprises. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent research on Web-based RP&amp;M systems. Various architectures proposed for Web-based RP&amp;M systems are presented. Furthermore, some key issues and enabling tools to implement the remote RP&amp;M systems, which involve (1) RP&amp;M process selection, (2) RP price quotation, (3) STL Viewer, (4) RP data pre-processing, (5) job planning and scheduling, (6) remote control and monitoring for RP machines, (7) security management, (8) applying new technologies and concepts to the systems, are described in detail. Finally, this review gives an outlook on possible future development and research direction for Web-based RP&amp;M systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainability addresses the companies' activities to implement sustainable requirements across the whole value chain. In theory, relationship management and co-creation processes face this challenge. Relationship management emphasizes the on-going relationship between the company and selective stakeholders to enduring entrepreneurial success. Co-creation means including well-selected stakeholders, e.g. customers or suppliers, in the innovation process on a targeted basis. Co-creation processes are predominantly separated from relationship and sustainability innovation management processes in practice. The article intends to contribute theoretically and empirically to this area of research addressing the following research question: How do companies combine co-creation and relationship management approaches with respect to sustainability? An exploratory multiple case study design was used in order to meet this background. In the period of March 2006 until December 2011 nine mainly German-based companies were analyzed for their co-creation and relationship management processes using different tools like innovation workshops or idea competitions. In addition, several company representatives were interviewed. Content analysis and action research, including observation, were used. This study highlights the lack in integrating sustainability co-creation and relationship management. Co-creation processes are not yet focused on the whole value chain, and thus, mostly do not integrate different stakeholders in order to minimize negative social and ecological impacts. Sustainability relationship management has to be anchored in a specific department. Sustainability innovation management should consider that the used tools and the way of interacting with stakeholders have an influence on the process' outcome and the sustainability impact.

Abstract: In many manufacturing processes, some key process parameters (i.e., system inputs) have very strong relationship with the categories (e.g., normal or various faulty products) of finished products (i.e., system outputs). The abnormal changes of these process parameters could result in various categories of faulty products. In this paper, a hybrid learning-based model is developed for on-line intelligent monitoring and diagnosis of the manufacturing processes. In the proposed model, a knowledge-based artificial neural network (KBANN) is developed for monitoring the manufacturing process and recognizing faulty quality categories of the products being produced. In addition, a genetic algorithm (GA)-based rule extraction approach named GARule is developed to discover the causal relationship between manufacturing parameters and product quality. These extracted rules are applied for diagnosis of the manufacturing process, provide guidelines on improving the product quality, and are used to construct KBANN. Therefore, the seamless integration of GARule and KBANN provides abnormal warnings, reveals assignable cause(s), and helps operators optimally set the process parameters. The proposed model is successfully applied to a japing-line, which improves the product quality and saves manufacturing cost.

Abstract: Abstract
The software intensive industry is moving towards the adoption of a value-driven and adaptive real-time business paradigm. The traditional view of software as an item that evolves through releases every few months is being replaced by the continuous evolution of software functionality. This study aims to classify and analyse the literature related to continuous deployment in the software domain in order to scope the phenomenon, provide an overview of the state-of-the-art, investigate the scientific evidence in the reported results and identify areas suitable for further research. We conducted a systematic mapping study and classified the continuous deployment literature. The benefits and challenges related to continuous deployment were also analysed. RESULTS: The systematic mapping study includes 50 primary studies published between 2001 and 2014. An in-depth analysis of the primary studies revealed ten recurrent themes that characterize continuous deployment and provide researchers with directions for future work. In addition, a set of benefits and challenges of which practitioners may take advantage were identified. CONCLUSION: Overall, although the topic area is very promising, it is still in its infancy, thus offering a plethora of new opportunities for both researchers and software intensive companies.

Abstract: Abstract
The increase of public attention, scientific research and political interest in environmental problems associated with transportation has provided the motivation for re-invention of electric vehicles. However the usage of grid-dependent EVs with a high-carbon electricity grid might produce more damage to the environment. This study aims to provide an environmental impact comparison of ICEVs, HEVs and EVs during their usage cycle, by modeling their energy consumption (electricity or fuel) and the supply chains of the supplied energy, (well-to-wheel) based on a life cycle assessment. The results show that running EVs with the existing mixed sources of electrical energy produce larger impacts on the environment 60% of the time; when compared to HEVs. When compared to ICEVs, EVs produce a larger environmental impact on 7 out of 15 environmental impact categories. Overall the environmental impacts of EVs are substantial based on the well-to-wheel analysis. It will continue to be so if no change is made to the methods of electricity generation in the near future. Given that the environmental profile of EVs is linked with the existing national electricity generation mix, the national electricity supply must be made cleaner before the electrification of the urban transport system.

Abstract: This paper asks to what extent sectoral or other innovation systems support the innovation performance of forest holdings. Special focus is put on product and service innovations, as these tend to create new income and employment in forestry and therefore contribute to rural development. In the course of a joint, coordinated research project by research institutions from Central European countries, the innovation behaviour of forest holdings, innovation systems and cases of successful innovations were investigated in these countries.

Analysis shows that the sectoral innovation systems in forestry, as is typical for innovation systems in traditional sectors, are focused mainly on process innovations. Support of product and service innovations by the forestry institutional system is limited to diffusion programmes for selected topics. The development of product and service innovations — as studied using the examples of nature conservation and bio-energy — is typically supported in cross-sectoral regional innovation arenas rather than in well-developed sectoral or regional innovation systems. Only the diffusion of these innovations is supported by forestry sectoral innovation systems. It is concluded that for the purpose of fostering product and service innovations in forestry, more systematic cross-sectoral interaction by the forestry institutional system with other sectors and support of innovations at an earlier stage would probably increase the rate of innovation in the sector.

Abstract: Although Chinese manufacturers are considered as latecomers or followers in global commodity chains, they have also been experiencing rapid progress in upgrading performance from own equipment manufacturing (OEM), original design manufacturing (ODM) to own brand manufacturing (OBM). Current literature on the global commodity chain has focused primarily on economic conditions that help explain manufacture upgrade while giving limited attention to what marketing capabilities support and sustain firm competitiveness through upgrading. This article examines eight different marketing capabilities to assess influence on manufacture upgrade performance. A survey of electronics manufacturers in mainland China and Hong Kong shows the significance of individual marketing capabilities and implications of their interdependency for manufacture upgrade performance. In particular, product development, marketing communication and channel management capabilities are crucial for manufacture upgrade. The results also highlight the importance of selective marketing capability development and the potential of secondary support for the relationship between substantive and dynamic capabilities.

Abstract: Abstract
Agroforestry systems, which include woodlands, pasturelands and various livestock species, are multifunctional systems that must be productive in order to guarantee their conservation, as well as their provision of services such as the maintenance of the landscape and/or cultural uses.

These systems generate commercial and environmental values, which are not always perceived by the society. It is therefore necessary to analyse the value society places in agroforestry systems, with a special focus on the dehesa system as a paradigmatic example.

The information has been obtained from 4 focus groups organised in Badajoz and Caceres (Spain) in May/June 2015. The discussions involved 35 people with an even distribution of age and gender being sought for each group.

The results of the study revealed a lack of citizen familiarity with the agroforestry system, as well as of the services it supplies, besides those that are purely associated to food production. Other key findings were the low importance given by the consumers to the item “production system” – a key aspect in order to valorize the products derived from these systems – as well as the difficulty perceived by the citizens in finding a compensation for the proprietors of these systems as suppliers of ecosystem-related services.

In summary, it has become clear that it is necessary to implement specific policies and complement the existing ones so that system proprietors can be financially remunerated for the services supplied to the society, although citizen awareness must also be reinforced so that they become conscious of the goods they receive from the agrosystems and therefore understand their value.

Abstract: Objectives
Health care delivery is particularly problematic in fragile states often connected with increased incidence of communicable diseases, among them tuberculosis. This article draws upon experiences in tuberculosis control in four fragile states from which four lessons learned were derived.
Methods
A structured inventory to extract common themes specific for TB control in fragile states was conducted among twelve providers of technical assistance who have worked in fragile states. The themes were applied to the TB control programs of Afghanistan, DR Congo, Haiti and Somalia during the years 2000–2006.
Results
Case notifications and treatment outcomes have increased in all four countries since 2003 (treatment success rates 81–90%). Access to care and case detection however have remained insufficient (case detection rates 39–62%); There are four lessons learned: 1. TB control programs can function in fragile states. 2. National program leadership and stewardship are essential for quality and sustained TB control. 3. Partnerships with non-governmental providers are vital for continuous service delivery; 4. TB control programs in fragile states require consistent donor support.
Conclusion
Despite challenges in management, coordination, security, logistics and funding, TB control programs can function in fragile states, but face considerable problems in access to diagnosis and treatment and therefore case detection.

Abstract: Abstract
We develop an improved approach to evaluate car sharing options under uncertain environments with the combination of Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (F-AHP) and Fuzzy Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (F-TOPSIS), which consists of three steps. In the first step, we propose a SCUMN (Specific, Comprehensive, Understandable, Measurable, and Neutral) methodology to identify appropriate indicators and obtain a final list of 24 indicators according to their relevance to car sharing options. In the second step, we determine the weight of each indicator with F-AHP and conduct consistency check of the comparison matrix of selected indicators. In the third step, comparison of different options is performed with selected indicators and F-TOPSIS. A case study is provided to validate the proposed approach. Twenty-four indicators are identified to evaluate five different car sharing options and rank them according to their closeness coefficients in decreasing order. And thirty-one sensitivity analysis experiments are conducted to figure out the influence of indicators on decision making. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is capable of evaluating car sharing options with uncertainty and vagueness. F-AHP is able to determine the weight for each selected indicator and F-TOPSIS demonstrates its advantage in comparing potential options.

Abstract: Abstract
Social media have become a major channel through which consumers interact with firms and other consumers. This paper examines the factors that drive consumers to co-create in social media and proposes a theoretical model that extends the theory of planned behavior to include perceived usefulness as a key antecedent of consumer attitudes toward co-creation in social media. The model was tested using responses from 743 Chinese consumers. Results of structural equation modeling confirmed that perceived usefulness was an antecedent of consumer attitudes toward co-creation in social media. The relationship between perceived usefulness and customer attitudes toward co-creation was moderated by the level of consumer involvement, and that relationship was found to be more salient for a high rather than a low level of consumer involvement. Practical and theoretical implications are given.

Abstract: Abstract
Waste policy is increasingly moving on from the ‘prevention of waste’ to a ‘sustainable materials policy’ focused agenda recognising individual wastes as a resource. In order to comparatively analyse policy developments in enhanced waste management, three case studies were selected; San Francisco’s Zero Waste Program, Flanders’s Sustainable Materials Management Initiative and Japan’s Sound Material-Cycle Society Plan. These case studies were chosen as an opportunity to investigate the variety of leading approaches, governance structures, and enhanced waste policy outcomes, emerging globally. This paper concludes that the current transitional state of waste management across the world, is only in the first leg of the journey towards Circular Economy closed loop production models of waste as a resource material. It is suggested that further development in government policy, planning and behaviour change is required. A focus on material policy and incorporating multiple front runners across industry and knowledge institutions are offered as potential directions in the movement away from end-pipe land-fill solutions.

Abstract: Abstract
In the last decade, the integrated transdisciplinary concepts and technologies for greener and more sustainable innovations and applications of Cleaner Production in the Asia–Pacific region have been developed and implemented extensively. The endeavor to develop more precise, reliable, and cost-effective tools and methods to assess the sustainability of the desired products and processes from Cleaner Production have been achieved. Regarding the two conferences, the International Conference on Green and Sustainable Innovation (ICGSI) and the International Thai Chemical Engineering and Applied Chemistry Conference (ITIChE2015), these conferences were co-organized to bring experts and researchers together from within and outside the Asia–Pacific region to foster development of new research ideas on green and sustainable innovation. The selected articles from these events are included within this Special Volume together with articles from the Cleaner Production community outside these events. The papers cover a wide range of topics relevant to the Cleaner Production concepts and applications, especially for greener and more sustainable innovations and of applications of life cycle assessment, ecological footprint, and other environmental and ecological assessment tools for making improvements in agricultural products, biodiesel and biogas production, CO2 reduction and utilization, and expansion of usage of alternative and renewable energies. The examples of life cycle thinking-based assessment techniques, together with progress in innovative technologies and their applications, strongly reflected the improvements made in practical applications of Cleaner Production in the Asia–Pacific region, in recent years.

Abstract: Considering the traditional indicator of Green GDP and EDP, which ignored the ecological content when used to assess the regional sustainable development level, we proposed a new indicator, “EcoDP”, which consists of five sub-indicators: eco-service domestic product, eco-disaster domestic product, eco-construction domestic product, eco-threat domestic product, and eco-protection cost input, to distinguish the traditional EDP; we also suggest that the “EcoDP” should rather be divided into two main types: the “EcoDP value-stocked” and the “EcoDP value-added”. An analysis is carried out of China's “EcoDP” change from 1999 to 2008, providing the following figures for the past 10 years: eco-service domestic product rose by 0.11 trillion yuan; eco-disaster domestic product increased by ¥1.03 trillion; eco-construction domestic product dropped by ¥9.8 billion; eco-threat domestic product rose by ¥114.4 billion; eco-protection cost input grew by ¥431.1 billion; and then we discussed the reasons for this change in China's “EcoDP” from the perspectives of ecosystem, environment, resources and energies. Finally, based on various uncertainties regarding the research methodology adopted, the paper considers how to conduct quantified research and assessment for regional sustainable development in a comprehensive way in the future, in terms of GDP, EDP and social domestic product, like HDI.

Abstract: Abstract
Components of automation technology have a special position in the area of sustainability. Each component has limited impact on sustainability indicators and business-to-business customers only have a small physical and emotional involvement with the product. However, interesting leverage might be given since the components are sold in large numbers and influence the system they are built in. Based on this background information, this paper provides a framework to consider all stakeholders perspectives in order to avoid trade-offs between them and to push “win-win-win-situations”. Concrete measures for automation technology are allocated to the sustainability strategies and quantified through a product example.

Abstract: The history of food acceptance research by the US Army in Chicago and Natick is reviewed. The review covers the staff of the two research centers, the research programs, and the significant accomplishments of the Army laboratories from the 1940s to the present. Accomplishments begin with the development of the nine-point hedonic scale, and the development of the first Food Acceptance Laboratory. Further accomplishments include studies of sensory psychophysics, food preferences, food choice and food intake. The laboratories designed methods and conducted research on the role of consumer variables in the acceptance of food products and food service systems. Recent work has focused on new scaling approaches, the role of contextual factors and the importance of product expectations. Throughout the period of the review, the Army research has examined the relationship of laboratory acceptance to field acceptance, and the relationship of acceptance to intake.

Por meio da análise sistemática de literatura, foram analisadas as principais contribuições dessas publicações e identificaram‐se quatro problemáticas principais: ontologia; uma opção para consumo e seus direcionadores; tecnologia; e gestão dos negócios colaborativos. Por fim, este artigo oferece um panorama das pesquisas em consumo colaborativo e economia compartilhada a partir das problemáticas identificadas, além de identificar a oportunidade para futuras pesquisas que possam analisar esse fenômeno, refinar e testar as abordagens teóricas.
Abstract
Although sharing economy is a recent phenomenon, it has been increasingly spread. Many sharing economy companies have become successful and sustainable business models, which evinces the great potential of this phenomenon for economic development. Aiming to expand the knowledge of this economic phenomenon, it was sought to respond to how the study of Sharing Economy and Collaborative Consumption has evolved and what the trends presented in the international scientific production are. This research analyzed the international scientific publications related to the Sharing Economy and Collaborative Consumption themes, which makes the construction of a map of the published studies possible. From the bibliometric analysis of articles indexed in the Scopus, Web of Science, Springer Link, Wiley Online Library, SciVerse ScienceDirect and SAGE collections, between 1978 and February 2016, 44 articles, written by 77 authors and published in 35 journals, were found. Moreover, through systematic analysis of the literature, the main contributions of these publications were analyzed by identifying four major issues: Ontology, An alternative to consumption and its drivers, Technology, and Collaborative Business Management. Finally, this article provides an overview of the research in Collaborative Consumption and Sharing Economy from the issues identified, and it also identifies opportunity for future research that might analyze this phenomenon by refining and testing the theoretical approaches.

Abstract: Increasingly products and services result from interactions among people who work across organizational, geographical, cultural and temporal boundaries. This has major implications for human factors and ergonomics (HFE), in particular, challenging the limits of the systems to be designed, and widening the range of system elements and dimensions that we need to consider. The design of sociotechnical systems that involve work across multiple boundaries requires better integration of the various sub-disciplines or components of HFE, as well as increased collaboration with other disciplines that provide either expertise regarding the domain of application or expertise in concepts that can enrich the system design.

In addition, ‘customers’ contribute significantly to the ‘co-production’ of products/services, as well as to their quality/safety. The design of sociotechnical systems in collaboration with both the workers in the systems and the customers requires increasing attention not only to the design and implementation of systems, but also to the continuous adaptation and improvement of systems in collaboration with customers.

This paper draws from research on human factors in the domains of health care and patient safety and of computer security.

Abstract: Abstract
Electric vehicles seem to offer a great potential for sustainable transport development. The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. In the first paper of this tandem publication, the authors propose a new generic process model embedding the Framework of Strategic Sustainable Development. The purpose of applying it in an action-research mode as described in this paper was twofold: (i) to develop a vision for sustainable regional transport and a coarse roadmap towards that vision, and, while doing so, (ii) get additional empirical experiences to inform the development of the new generic process model. Experts from many sectors and organizations involved in the GreenCharge project provided vital information and reviewed all planning perspectives presented in Paper 1 in two sequential multi-stakeholder seminars. The results include a sustainable vision for electric vehicle systems in southeast Sweden within a sustainable regional transport system within a sustainable global society, as well as an initial development plan towards such a vision for the transport sector. The vision is framed by the universal sustainability principles, and the development plan is informed by the strategic guidelines, of the above-mentioned framework. Among other things, the vision and plan imply a shift to renewable energy and a more optimized use of areas and thus a new type of spatial planning. For example, the vision and plan implies a lower built-in demand for transport, more integrated traffic modes, and more multi-functional use of areas for energy and transport infrastructures, for example. Some inherent benefits of electric vehicles are highlighted in the vision and plan, including near-zero local emissions and flexibility as regards primary energy sources. The vision and plan also imply improved governance for more effective cross-sector collaboration to ensure coordinated development within the transport sector and between the transportation sector and other relevant sectors. Meanwhile, the new generic process model was refined and is ready to be applied and further tested in the GreenCharge project and in other projects within the transport sector as well as other sectors. The study confirmed that the new generic process model suggested in support of sustainable transport system and community development is helpful for giving diverse stakeholders, with various specialties and perspectives, a way of working that is goal-oriented and builds on effective, iterative learning loops and co-creation.

Abstract: Abstract
Electric vehicles seem to offer a great potential for sustainable transport development. The Swedish pioneer project GreenCharge Southeast is designed as a cooperative action research approach that aims to explore a roadmap for a fossil-free transport system by 2030 with a focus on electric vehicles. It is the following combination of objectives that puts demand on a new process model adapted for cross-sector and cross-disciplinary cooperation: (i) a fossil-free transport system in Sweden by 2030 and, to avoid sub-optimizations in the transport sector, (ii) assuring that solutions that support (i) also serve other aspects of sustainability in the transport sector and, to avoid that sustainable solutions in the transport sector block sustainable solutions in other sectors, (iii) assuring cohesive creativity across sectors and groups of experts and stakeholders. The new process model was applied in an action-research mode for the exploration of electric vehicles within a fully sustainable transport system to test the functionality of the model in support of its development. To deliver on the above combination of objectives, a framework was needed with principles for sustainability that are universal for any sector as boundary conditions for redesign, and with guidelines for how any organization or sector can create economically feasible step-by-step transition plans. The Framework for Strategic Sustainable Development (FSSD) is designed to serve such purposes and therefore is embedded into the new process model. The exploration of this new model also helped to identify four interdependent planning perspectives (‘Resource base’, ‘Spatial’, ‘Technical’ and ‘Governance’) that should be represented by the respective experts and stakeholders using the model. In general, the new process model proved helpful by giving diverse stakeholders with various competences and representing various planning perspectives a common, robust, and easy-to-understand goal and a way of working that was adequate for each of their contexts. Furthermore, the evolving process model likely is relevant and useful not only for transport planning and electric vehicles, but for any other societal sector as well and thus for sustainable community planning in general.

Abstract: Abstract
Significant high levels of available waste tires in Brazil, which reached approximately 473 thousand tons in 2015, offer an attractive potential for their use as fuel in advanced thermal conversion processes. Technologies for energetic valorization of waste tires were reviewed and two alternatives based on updraft gasification in a modified reactor design were proposed. First of all, a large-scale updraft gasifier on IGCC (Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle) was considered for the gasification of the derived fuel from waste tires, capable to produce between 10.8 and 16.1 MJ of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. The second alternative considered a small-scale updraft gasifier feeding an internal combustion engine, coupled to an electricity generator for the production of up to 8.2 MJ of electric energy per kg of derived fuel from waste tires fed to the reactor. Implementation of these technologies will allow energetic valorization of waste tires in Brazil, solving their disposal problems, creating jobs, reducing negative disposal environmental impacts in landfills, and increasing distributed generation of electricity.

Abstract: Abstract
The California tomato processing industry produced circa 388,856 t of tomato pomace in 2014. While currently used for animal feed, tomato pomace could be utilized for biosolarization. Primary Energy Demand (PED) and Global Warming Potential (GWP) equivalent emissions were calculated for two valorization pathways: (i) feed for cattle; and (ii) biosolarization. In order to make these two valorization pathways comparable three management options were analyzed whereby each part of the system was satisfied, i.e. a pest management sub-system and a cattle feed sub-system. The management options were (1) tomato pomace used for cattle feed and soil pest control using fumigant Telone II and herbicide glyphosate; (2) tomato pomace used for cattle feed and soil pest control using solarization; (3) alternative cattle feed (cottonseed, canola pellets and wheat straw) and soil pest control using biosolarization with tomato pomace. Options 2 and 3 result in a reduction of GWP and PED. Among management options, the GWP ranged from 64–98 kg CO2-e and 1502–2250 MJ for PED per t of pomace. The majority of impacts were beyond the tomato processors’ immediate control, therefore encouraging the diversion of tomato pomace to biosolarization may be desirable. Total savings per annum for biosolarization could be as large as 7.7 M kg CO2-e and 203,000 GJ annually.

Abstract: Abstract
Patents are the main source of data on innovation. Since most of the innovative activity happens outside of the patenting system, and since patents −and innovations- have different quality, complexity, and impact on each market, unweighted sums of patents and proxies are an imperfect indicator of a country’s innovative activity. I generate two very simple indices of innovation (one dependent on the size of a country, and another that normalizes country-size), based on weighting patents and exports by a complexity measure. Each index captures the technological complexity of innovations inside and outside the intellectual property rights system. I empirically analyze the rankings of these innovation indices, and contrast the results with technological development, GDP, and the existing mainstream innovation index.

Abstract: Abstract
Ground penetrating radar (GPR) is one of the most promising and effective non-destructive testing techniques (NDTs), particularly for the interpretation of the soil properties. Within the framework of international Agencies dealing with the standardization of NDTs, the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) has published several standard test methods related to GPR, none of which is focused on a detailed analysis of the system performance, particularly in terms of precision and bias of the testing variable under consideration. This work proposes a GPR signal processing methodology, calibrated and validated on the basis of a consistent amount of data collected by means of laboratory-scale tests, to assess the performance of the above standard test methods for GPR systems. The (theoretical) expressions of the bias and variance of the estimation error are here investigated by a reduced Taylor's expansion up to the second order. Therefore, a closed form expression for theoretically tuning the optimal threshold according to a fixed target value of the GPR signal stability is proposed. Finally, the study is extended to GPR systems with different antenna frequencies to analyze the specific relationship between the frequency of investigation, the optimal thresholds, and the signal stability.

Abstract: Abstract
Beef cattle production is a widespread activity in Italy in the agricultural field and determines an important impact on environment and resources consumption. Carbon footprint evaluation is thus necessary to evaluate the contributions of the different stages and the possible improvements of the production chain.

In this study, two typical Italian beef production systems, a conventional and an organic one are investigated in order to evaluate the greenhouse gas emissions from “cradle to gate farm” by a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) approach; the carbon footprint (CF) per 1 kg of live weight meat is calculated.

The contributions from feed production, enteric fermentation, and manure management are taken into account, in order to compare the life cycle of the two productions; also the carbon balance in soil is evaluated, in order to verify the impact in a life cycle perspective.

The results of CF calculation of the two farms show that organic system (24.62 kg CO2eq/kg live weight) produce more GHG emissions than the conventional one (18.21 kg CO2eq/kg live weight) and that the enteric fermentation is the more heavy contribution, with a range of 50–54% of the global CF value. Improvements of the production chain could be realized by accurate feeding strategies, in order to obtain reduction of methane emissions from enteric digestion of cattles.

Abstract: Abstract
Cleaner production methods and environmental management practices are tools that strive for production process efficiency, the use of its input and the generation of industrial waste. These tools can significantly contribute to sustainable product innovation, due to the rational use of natural resources and the minimization of generated wastes. This study aims to measure the relations between the conditions for sustainable product innovation, considering the constructs of cleaner production and environmental management. It also examines the relationship between sustainable conditions and product innovation and financial performance as well as the size of the moderating effect of the companies on the relationship between the constructs. In this context, a Survey in 762 companies of different sizes was carried out in a leading metal-mechanic sector in Brazil. Structural Equation Modeling methods were used for results analysis. The research highlights that both Cleaner production and Environmental Management influence positively the achievement of Sustainable Product Innovation. The surveyed companies developing Sustainable Product Innovation Financial had higher performance in comparison to other companies. Another result of this study shows the strong relationship between the constructs “Cleaner production” and “Environmental Management”. It is recommended that companies combine these constructs to increase the results of sustainable innovation and financial gain. Accordingly, the way for companies to produce new environmentally sustainable products is through the presence of cleaner production and environmental management practices. The scientific value of this research is to provide for the academic community a framework for the analysis of the relations of the categories constitutes the main contribution, as well as providing management information to decide on the implementation of sustainability programs, resulting in higher financial gains through product innovations sustainable.

Abstract: Abstract
Hydrogen fuel cell vehicles have the potential to contribute to a sustainable transport system with zero tailpipe emissions. This requires the construction of a network of fuel stations, a long-term, expensive and highly uncertain investment. We contribute to the literature by including a knock-out barrier option in an n-fold compound real option model to take account of immediate project failure in a multi-stage sequential investment project. Our model allows to explicitly incorporate the default possibility of large-scale energy infrastructure projects. In our case study of hydrogen infrastructure development, we find that even for the least conservative valuation method no profitable business case can be made for the development of hydrogen as a sustainable transportation mode. However, we do provide some suggestive scenarios that plausible tax schedules can be designed to overcome the starting problems for hydrogen infrastructure development.

The traditional manufacturing industry should shift to the manufacturing-service industry that provides both of products and through-life engineering services. However, it seems that Japanese manufacturing industry cannot follow this trend. This paper discusses two issues of Japanese manufacturing industry in shifting to the manufacturing-service industry. Then, we propose “life cycle value creation platform” as a future image of manufacturing and point out the importance of “meso level thinking” and its education for encouraging design of the life cycle value creation platform.

Abstract: Abstract
The aim of this article is to explore how ecodesign dilemmas contribute to a firm's ecodesign evolution. The article achieves this through empirical research into a process of ecodesign decision-making in a single firm. The study spans a timeframe of nine years. The article describes how recognising and dealing with ecodesign dilemmas fuels cycles of learning, leading the firm towards business model innovation. The study classifies a unique set of ecodesign dilemmas: hierarchies; tensions; contradictions; and oversights. Through this classification, we show how firms need to adopt a unified approach combining operational (ecodesign principles approach), tactical (ecodesign management processes) and strategic actions (business model innovation), to systematically manage ecodesign dilemmas. To support this, the article presents a framework describing key actions for operational, tactical and strategic ecodesign decision-making and the types of ecodesign dilemmas typical to each approach. Through this study, we show that the business model is critical to inform effective ecodesign decision-making and illustrate how design can drive firms towards sustainable change, from the bottom up.

Abstract: Abstract
Among the various reasons to engage in foresight activities, one encountered often is to stimulate dialogue on imminent issues and inspire innovations aimed at the challenges they bring along. The authors' studio, Pantopicon, was asked to carry out a (near future) foresight desk study investigating the changing role between people and their home/office interiors. Furthermore they were asked to render tangible the challenges brought forward by this study and create a thought-provoking experience for an audience of professionals and general visitors within the context of a trade fair (i.e. the Biennale Interieur in Kortrijk, Belgium). The article will zoom in on the particular way in which this challenge was taken up, i.e. by creating an immersive experience embodying imminent future changes by means of five fair booths. Each represented a fictitious company with products or services aimed at new needs, opportunities and abilities emerging from changes in the relationship between people and their home interiors. This article describes the follow-up approach, the results obtained and reflects upon a series of key learnings following from the experience in particular and the role and value of conceptual design in enhancing the experience factor in foresight in general. Hence, we aim to illustrate how an immersive conceptual design approach can be used in an applied foresight context and how it raises new questions and opportunities for both research and applied contexts. Through physical evidencing11
as in (Tassi, 2009)
 and open-ended storytelling, futures rendered tangible through design contribute to instilling a sense of wonder in people, in shifting their mindset to render them more susceptible to anticipating some of tomorrow’s changes.

Abstract: Abstract
Pay-per-use services are an interesting phenomenon, both empirically and theoretically. Despite the alleged benefits, companies still struggle to succeed with pay-per-use services. Theoretically, it is common sense that existing service capabilities cannot easily be converted into organizational capabilities for pay-per-use services. Based on multiple case studies, the present article narrows down the existing empirical and theoretical gaps through an inductive research approach. Our findings make the following contributions to the field of services in product-oriented companies and to the servitization literature. We describe the organizational capabilities necessary for pay-per-use services (e.g., financing such services, aligning costs with equipment usage, and collaborating with customers). We reveal that companies should convert these capabilities into three core competencies (strategizing pay-per-use services, utilizing technologies for pay-per-use services, and de-risking pay-per-use services), in order to achieve competitive advantages.

Abstract: Abstract
In developed countries, industrial companies are facing challenges for competitiveness from countries with lower labor costs or less demanding environmental standards. Increasing production costs (material and labor), customer demand for more sophisticated products while purchasing power is decreasing and stricter environmental regulations are becoming strategic issues for the viability of industries. Eurêcook is an action research program aiming to construct and test a rental service offer for small household equipment in a medium-size French conurbation. A local ecosystem of actors is involved in providing a satisfactory service for consumers.

Our role, as researchers, is to assess the environmental and societal changes caused by the business model transition. We assume success depends not only on a positive LCA but also on a climate of confidence and co-operation between stakeholders, as well as consumers’ behavioral change and appropriation of the project. A multidisciplinary method for sustainability assessment has been developed combining concepts and tools from social sciences with environmental and engineering sciences.

Firstly, the current challenges for B-to-C PSS are obtained from a multidisciplinary review of literature and practice. Then, the socio-economic and environmental context and specific issues linked to small appliances were clarified. Thirdly, the case study is detailed: structuration of the offer, specific challenges and first observations. Finally, our method is presented and discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
In this paper, we examine the impact of stakeholder governance on corporate social responsibility (CSR) around the world to determine whether CSR is employed as a mechanism to mitigate conflicts of interest between managers and diverse stakeholders, or used as managerial perquisites. To examine this relation properly, we not only employ a large and extensive sample of international firms, but also control for endogeneity by using dynamic panel generalized method of moments (GMM), propensity score matching, and difference-in-difference approach. Our results suggest that stakeholder governance positively influences firms’ CSR engagement with a greater magnitude than board governance after controlling for endogeneity and other confounding factors of traditional corporate governance mechanisms, firm characteristics and national factors. Stakeholders’ influence in CSR engagement is more prevalent when investor protections and board governance are relatively weak.

Abstract: Abstract
It is common for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of high value products to provide maintenance or service packages to customers to ensure their products are maintained at peak efficiency throughout their life. To quickly and efficiently plan for maintenance requirements, OEMs require accurate information about the use and wear of their products. In recent decades, the aerospace industry in particular has become expert in using real time data for the purpose of product monitoring and maintenance scheduling. Significant quantities of real time usage data from product monitoring are commonly generated and transmitted back to the OEMs, where diagnostic and prognostic analysis will be carried out. More recently, other industries such as construction and automotive, are also starting to develop capabilities in these areas and condition based maintenance (CBM) is increasing in popularity as a means of satisfying customers’ demands. CBM requires constant monitoring of real time product data by the OEMs, however the biggest challenge for these industries, in particular construction, is the lack of accurate and real time understanding of how their products are being used possibly because of the complex supply chains which exist in construction projects. This research focuses on current dynamic data acquisition techniques for mobile hydraulic systems, in this case the use of a mobile inline particle contamination sensor; the aim was to assess suitability to achieve both diagnostic and prognostic requirements of Condition Based Maintenance. It concludes that hydraulic oil contamination analysis, namely detection of metallic particulates, offers a reliable way to measure real time wear of hydraulic components.

Abstract: Abstract
With the convergence of information and communication technology (ICT) industries in the mobile communication sectors, new actors have started emerging such as mobile contents and media service industries. The traditional distribution of power in ICT industries of mobile communication sectors has significantly changed based on relations with the new actors. Recently, the concept of a “mobile ecosystem” which embraces this environmental shift is highlighted. The traditional industries such as hardware and network-based firms and new ICT industries such as software and service-based firms grow up simultaneously creating the mobile ecosystem. In this respect, this study aims to explore ecological indexes for identifying roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem. To be specific, the ecological indexes are proposed to take new roles and position of ICT industries in the perspective of ecosystem into account. For this, the inter-industry analysis, which includes the physical flows between industries, is mainly used since the ecosystem is operated by streamlining physical flows. First, the mobile ecosystem is structured by using physical input-output flows and industrial relationships. Second, to explore roles of ICT industries in the mobile ecosystem, four ecological indexes have been developed and combined based on the result of inter-industry analysis: productivity, size, spillover effect, and coverage. As a result, we identified six roles for ICT industries and their relationships: commodity, landlord, controller, keystone, facilitator, and dominator. Regarding these ecological roles and relationships in ICT industries, strategic and policy implications are also suggested to improve the health of the mobile ecosystem.

Abstract: Abstract
In the last decades, green and sustainable supply chain management practices have been developed, trying to integrate environmental concerns into organisations by reducing unintended negative consequences on the environment of production and consumption processes. In parallel to this, the circular economy discourse has been propagated in the industrial ecology literature and practice. Circular economy pushes the frontiers of environmental sustainability by emphasising the idea of transforming products in such a way that there are workable relationships between ecological systems and economic growth. Therefore, circular economy is not just concerned with the reduction of the use of the environment as a sink for residuals but rather with the creation of self-sustaining production systems in which materials are used over and over again.

Through two case studies from different process industries (chemical and food), this paper compares the performances of traditional and circular production systems across a range of indicators. Direct, indirect and total lifecycle emissions, waste recovered, virgin resources use, as well as carbon maps (which provide a holistic visibility of the entire supply chain) are presented. The paper asserts that an integration of circular economy principles within sustainable supply chain management can provide clear advantages from an environmental point view.

Abstract: Abstract
Sustainability criteria used for decision support in the product innovation process and aligned throughout the design process is one key element to efficiently introduce a sustainability perspective early in product development. The aim of this paper is to present an approach for identifying such sustainability criteria and to suggest a process for how these can be developed in any manufacturing company. The sustainability criteria are presented in a set of matrices, separating the criteria into product life-cycle phases and socio-ecological sustainability principles. In addition the paper presents a qualitative measurement scale for the criteria, called a sustainability compliance index that indicates to what degree a product or process concept performs in relation to a sustainable solution. The sustainability criteria were tested in different settings at a case company within the aerospace industry to give a first indication and evaluation of the ability to give guidance and support in bringing in a sustainability perspective when developing, evaluating and selecting different concepts in the early phases of product development.

Abstract: Abstract
The degradation of the natural environment introduces a unique problem as it influences each individual stage in a product value chain and this poses a significant threat to low velocity industries. Systemic innovations produce complementary innovations in multiple areas of the value chain and large scale change is delivered through the cumulative effect of these complementary innovations. The change produced is similar in magnitude to radical innovations, yet the resultant change is not radical as it enhances the capabilities of incumbent firms. Systemic innovations are not driven by technological change; instead they leverage knowledge of value chain interdependencies to reconfigure the existing product system in a more efficient manner. In this article, a framework is developed which shows how resources and capabilities can be reconfigured to implement systemic innovations in low velocity industries with the aim of reducing environmental impact. This article also adds to the empirical research on product stewardship which has been largely overlooked by past research. It provides firms in low velocity industries with a roadmap for adapting to changes induced by the degradation of the natural environment. Firms should target innovations that have high systemicity as this maximizes the cumulative effect of the resultant complementary innovations.

Abstract: Abstract
There are many opportunities for consumers to design their lives more sustainably. While a rapidly growing body of literature has investigated how consumers can reduce carbon footprints in key consumption areas, such as food, housing and mobility, an overall framework that allows structuring those options across all consumption areas is still missing. Hence, this paper presents a novel and systematic framework to identify improvement options that promote climate change mitigation and structure them based on their primary mode of impact on GHG emissions. The framework targets consumer practices and focuses on ambitious, but technically and socioeconomically feasible strategies for consumers to lower their carbon footprint. Four major categories for reducing consumption-based emissions form the basic framework, which are then subdivided into behavioural strategies and sub-strategies. The practical application of the framework is illustrated by using food consumption as an example. Systematically identifying improvement options can advance a holistic understanding of the range of behavioural strategies targeting consumer choices that operate at different stages in the supply chain. It thus provides a starting point for addressing critical questions related to the role of consumers in supporting climate change mitigation.

Abstract: Abstract
Most of the world's poor live in developing markets and face unmet needs in core areas such as education, health, energy, sanitation and financial services. This offers businesses a vast opportunity for growth as these economies emerge from low-income to middle-income status. Social businesses in particular address a social need while generating profits typically reinvested into the business itself, but there is limited understanding of the ways through which social businesses achieve scale. This paper investigates how social businesses can scale up. First, we define scaling up as “increasing the number of customers or members of a business as well as expanding its offer and maximising its revenues until it reaches millions of people.” Second, using three in-depth case studies of social businesses that successfully scaled up according to these definitions, BRAC, Aravind and Amul, we identify scaling up strategies for social businesses. We identified market penetration, market development, product development and diversification as key strategies at different stages of business maturity. We find that there are two ways of increasing income generated that are linked to these four strategies: increasing revenue per stream and diversifying revenue streams. Our findings give insight to companies aiming to pursue social businesses and adds to the sparse literature on scaling up social businesses. A fruitful future research avenue would be to investigate the best sequence for applying these scaling strategies across companies and sectors over time.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper provides a viable systems perspective of an outcome-based service initiative involving major manufacturers in the defence industry. The viable systems perspective allowed a coherent structuration of the complex servitization context involving provider and customer organizations. It also unveiled critical relationship mechanisms that enable synergy and facilitate the achievement of co-capability by the organizations involved. Through a case study approach, the research finds that interventions in the customer system reduce variability in the provider system as well as in the service system as a whole. The systemic interventions are implemented via key provider/customer relationships the study identifies. The relationships deal with the high level of internal variety in outcome-based service systems. A typology for the identified relationships is developed, offering a helpful basis for the purposeful planning and design of interactions aimed at developing co-capability. The paper also offers theoretical propositions defining fundamental features of outcome-based service systems. The unique characteristics of these systems addressed in this paper provide particularly useful insights concerning the implementation of this type of servitization initiative not only in the defence industry, but also in other industrial sectors where servitization initiatives involve complex configurations of provider and customer organizations.

Abstract: Abstract
As one of important building materials, the sustainability of cement production is widely concerned in the world. This research evaluated the sustainability of China’s cement industry in 2010 using emergy analysis. Several emergy based indicators were adopted to describe the comprehensive performance of this system from different angles, including Percentage of renewability (%R), Unit emergy value (UEV), Emergy yield ratio (EYR), Emergy exchange ratio (EER), Environmental load ratio (ELR) and Emergy sustainable index (ESI). The research results show that (1) Mineral resources have absolute contribution to China’s cement production; (2) Coal is the main energy source for China’s cement industry; (3) China’s cement industry has relatively weak competition ability due to relatively high ratio of purchased inputs; (4) China’s other industries have benefited greatly from this industry by exchanges; (5) China’s cement industry cannot keep sustainable in the long run due to its high environmental load; (6) the UEV of Chinese cement in 2010 is 3.64E15 sej/t (based on the emergy baseline 15.83E24 sej/yr). Finally, the related policy implications are proposed from four aspects, including (1) Accelerating the adjustment of process structure and technical innovation; (2) Promoting the substitution of raw materials or fuels; (3) Raising the price of cement products; (4) Decreasing the export of cement products.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays industrial parks have played a massive role in promoting regional economic development. However, due to intensive industrial activities and enormous energy consumption, industrial parks have become the main areas for pollution emissions. China has carried out the National Demonstration Eco-industrial Parks program to solve such challenges. Industrial symbiosis is the kernel of industrial ecological construction. It aims at promoting several companies to gather in a same geographical site to share services, utility, and by-products in order to decrease environmental impacts of their industrial activities. However how to quantify the impact of industrial symbiosis on improving the sustainability of an industrial park is rarely studied. This study proposed an emergy analysis to conduct an assessment on Hefei economic and technological development area to quantify the performance of industrial symbiosis. Comparing with conventional evaluation methods, emergy analysis can reflect the real contribution of local ecosystem by focusing on nature's free investment, not only the economic value or the resources supplied to the industrial system. Research results show that industrial symbiosis operations improve the study area's sustainable development ability by 33%. Specifically, non-renewable inputs, imported resource inputs, and associated services could be saved by 99.71%, 25.64%, and 9.82%, and the ratio of the money saving to the total gross domestic product of the industrial park would be 29.71%. By examining industrial symbiosis practices in detail within the system, this paper can describe the process of the industrial symbiosis and how these industrial symbiosis practices influence the overall performance of the industrial park. This study indicates that industrial symbiosis could effectively reduce raw materials and energy consumption and improve the overall sustainability, which can help policy-makers make decisions.

Abstract: Abstract
The mainstream servitization literature mostly describes the success of manufacturing firms in integrating services for their corporate clients. However, the literature is relatively silent on how territories capitalize on the potential interconnectedness between manufacturing firms and the knowledge-intensive business service (KIBS) sector. The analysis of the outcomes that result from the mutually dependent associations between manufacturing businesses and KIBS firms, a process that we call Territorial Servitization, is of great relevance for academics and policy makers. This research hypothesizes that there is a positive symbiotic and bidirectional link between the growth in KIBS activity and employment generation by manufacturing sector start-ups. Furthermore, we scrutinize the mediating role over this relation of relevant industry characteristics, in our case the stock of manufacturing firms and the total number of freights transported. The empirical application considers a unique dataset created from multiple sources—the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM), the Spanish Institute of Statistics and Eurostat—for the 17 Spanish regions during the period 2006–2012. The results support the view that territorial servitization contributes to employment creation in manufacturing sectors. Territories with a vigorous manufacturing base benefit from a virtuous circle in which KIBS start-ups and newly formed manufacturers are connected through the economic activity of incumbent manufacturing firms. The study offers valuable insights for scholars and policy makers on how to implement specific policies—e.g., the development of digital infrastructures—that facilitate the interaction between manufacturing and KIBS businesses, thus fuelling territorial development.

Abstract: Abstract
This study is related to an environmental impact assessment of a district heating system with geothermal (DHS/G). For a real application, the Afyon DHS/G was selected. An advanced exergo-environmental analysis was used as an environmental assessment methodology. From the environmental aspect, it was divided into unavoidable/avoidable, exogenous/endogenous and further categories to evaluate the potential to improve system components and the interaction between the components. The environmental impacts of the exergy destruction and component-related features were evaluated according to certain markers, and possible suggestions for improvement were made to diminish the environmental impacts. The results of the study showed that the environmental impact of the system was lower than that of the wood-fired heating system. Furthermore, there has been a focus on the environmental impacts of the exergy destruction of components because of their low component-related environmental impacts. Environmental effects in many of the components were self-induced. Priority needs to be placed on improving heat exchangers. Some suggestions have been made to improve the design of heat exchangers. Finally, advanced exergo-environmental analysis allows us to evaluate the system components from the environmental point of view and provides information on the possibility of designing improvements.

Abstract: Complaint behaviors are critical to maintaining customer loyalty in an online market. They provide insight into the customer's experience of service failure and help to redress the failures. Previous studies have shown the importance of customer satisfaction as a mediator for complaint intentions. It is important to examine the antecedents of customer satisfaction and its link to complaint intentions. Online shoppers are both buyers of products/services and users of web-based systems. Trust also plays a critical role in forming a psychological state with positive or negative feelings toward e-vendors. In this context, there are three major concerns: justice, technology and trust. This study proposes a research model to combine these issues, in order to investigate complaint intentions. Data were collected from an online survey wherein subjects were encouraged to reflect on recent service failure experiences. The results from testing a structural equation model indicate that distributive and interactional justice contribute significantly to customer satisfaction and, in turn, to complaint intentions, but procedural justice does not. Technology-based features and trust are also important in determining the two target variables. The implications for managers and scholars are also discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
In the last years, the circular economy (CE) paradigm is being widely explored by researchers and institutions as a possible path to increase the sustainability of our economic system. Reuse, repair and recycling are becoming crucial activities in many sectors. At the same time, companies are showing an increasing interest for this new economic model. However, the state of the art shows that a deep research on CE assessment and indicators is still lacking, in particular on the micro level. This work tries to fill this gap, first analyzing the current literature on CE assessment, then proposing a reference framework for the monitoring phase of a CE strategy. Finally, the main existing environmental assessment methodologies based on indexes are analyzed according to their suitability to evaluate the circularity of a system. A systematic approach for the choice of the adequate methodology is also provided, highlighting the main critical steps in the assessment of a CE strategy. Further research could be focused either on the extension of this approach to include other assessment methods, and on the validation of this proposal in a case study.

Abstract: Abstract
After sales services (ASS) are activities that take place after the purchase of the product by customers and are devoted to supporting customers in the use and disposal of goods. ASS can create sustainable relationships with customers and contribute significantly to customer satisfaction. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the ASS quality by measuring the level of customer satisfaction (CS), customer retention (CR) and customer loyalty (CL) through the SERVQUAL dimensions comprising of ASS attributes and also to check which such ASS-based dimensions of SERVQUAL needs to be focused more on improving the quality of ASS with the consideration of firms involved in manufacturing the home appliances. For this purpose research models were proposed to examine the influence of ASS attributes on CS, CR and CL for three different products such as Gas Stove, Water Purifier and Mixer Grinder from the home appliances sector and tested by multiple regression analyses on data collected through the structured survey questionnaire, with a five-point Likert scale. The study has demonstrated the application of multiple regression analysis in studying the influence of ASS attributes on CS, CR and CL, and the results of the study have helped in analysing the performance of the case companies so as to devise suitable strategies in improving CS, CR and CL.

Abstract: Accessible from all over the world, the EC became an indispensable element to our society. It allows the use of electronic systems to exchange products, services and information between the different existent users. During these exchanges, it is very important to assure a good quality of service. However, the enormous expansion of the Internet users push its resources to the maximum of its limits, which provoke, in many cases, an important degradation in its performance. Consequently, it is primordial to analyze the capacity of servers in order to handle heavy workloads that are growing considerably as a function of the number of users. It is, therefore, necessary to conduct performance tests before servers' deployment in order to detect any imperfection and predict their behavior under stress.

In this context, this paper present a simplified performance evaluation of the “alpha” version of a negotiation platform called Generic Negotiation Platform (GNP) dated on September 2000. This platform is still under development. Many performance factors could be examined in this evaluation. However, we considered only the response time factor because of its important impact on auctions and negotiations applications. We mostly oriented this study to give us an idea about the variation of the average response time of the server as a function of the number of users and the type of different transactions. We also tried to evaluate the effect of the auctions' rules on the server average response time. We limited our study to the close and open auctions at the second price.

This study followed the traditional way of doing performance tests. Therefore, we fixed our test objectives and criterion and then create our own scripts. Once the nature of the workload of the server was specified, we created an adequate benchmark to generate requests to the server. Afterwards, the average response time of each considered transaction was collected. In order to interpret these results properly, we calculated the standard deviation and the coefficient of variation of each set of values.

Abstract: Abstract
The effective delivery of industrial services requires systematic approaches for planning and organizing delivery processes and network partners. In order to be able to assess the performance of the service organization, significant key performance indicators are needed. The performance of the service organization is defined by its ability to effectively assign resources such as service technicians, tools and spare parts to service tasks and its ability to implement and deliver the service processes as planned. Thus, important key performance indicators for assessing the delivery and delivery planning of product-related industrial services are presented in this paper. The relevant performance indicators are classified based on their importance for measuring planning performance and delivery performance.

Abstract: Abstract
A variety of indicators is available for assessing the economic, environmental, and social aspects of an Eco-industrial park (EIP). The managers of a sustainability assessment over these parks should overcome an important task at the beginning of the study: to select indicators.

To support this activity, the challenge is to list and classify a large set of sustainability indicators. Consequently, the main achievements of this article are a wide search and classification of sustainability indicators, and the development of four criteria to filter indicators when assessing an EIP. A literature search in ISI Web of Science's database is presented to explore feasible indicators. The definition of 249 indicators is provided in an annotated list.

An important difficulty to use these indicators is to select a proper subset. To deal with this selection, this work proposes four criteria constructed to be functional, clear, and adaptable to the application context. The proposed criteria are: understanding, pragmatism, relevance, and partial representation of sustainability. The 249 indicators have been filtered using the four criteria, and have been classified according to three dimensions of sustainability (social, environmental, and economic dimensions).

The four criteria provide a formal way to filter a large set of possible indicators, improving the mechanism for their selection. In order to illustrate their application to select suitable indicators for the assessment of EIPs, a hypothetical case is constructed on the basis of an industrial park in Kalundborg. The selected indicators meet the four criteria and the evaluation goal.

Focusing on sustainability dimensions, many of the integrated indicators are related to the economic and environmental dimensions. Nevertheless, few of them are related to social dimension. Therefore, to cover the main aspects of each dimension of sustainability, a combination of single and integrated indicators should be included in this assessment.

Finally, four recommendations are made to select proper indicators during the sustainability assessment of an EIP: start with a large set of possible indicators, as those presented herein, preselect those indicators linked to the objectives of the assessment, apply the four criteria for indicators choice, and prefer comparative indicators.

Abstract: Population aging has been taking place in many countries across the globe and more recently in emerging countries. In this context, Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) has become one focus of attention, including methods, products, services, and AAL software systems that support the everyday lives of elderly people, promoting mainly their independence and dignity. From the perspective of computer science, efforts are already being dedicated to adequately developing AAL systems. However, in spite of its relevance, AAL has not been properly investigated in emerging countries, including Brazil. Thus, the contribution of this paper is to present the main perspectives of research in AAL, in particular in the area of software engineering, considering that the Brazilian population is also subject to the aging process. The main intention of this paper is to raise the interest of Brazilian researchers, as well as government and industry, for this important area.

Abstract: Abstract
Currently, industry is showing increasing interest in performance-based business models. Functional Products is one such business model, where the provider offers a function to customers at an agreed-upon level of availability, productivity or efficiency, etc. A Functional Product comprises the following four main constituents: hardware, software, service support system and management of operation, which together deliver value to customers on a long-term basis. This paper, based on empirical data, provides an outline and starts the verification of a proposed overall Functional Product lifecycle combining and coordinating its economic- and technical perspectives. The perspectives are combined and the key aspects of the necessary coordination between and within the perspectives, i.e., sustainable win-win situations and coordination of sub-lifecycles for the economic perspective, and the need for coordination between the Functional Products’ technical perspective's four sub-lifecycles (hardware, software, service-support system and management of operation), are elaborated and discussed. Further, addition of new functionality, contract management, and long-term management of operation are discussed in the light of managing fleets/individual customers, assets and availability. The proposed overall Functional Product lifecycle is further analyzed from a number of views and aspects.

Abstract: The article presents methods for defining product platforms and measuring business performance in process intensive industries. We first show how process intensive product platforms can be defined using the products and processes of a film manufacturer. We then present an empirical method for understanding the dynamics of process intensive platform innovation, allocating engineering and sales data to specific platform and product development efforts within a product family. We applied this method to a major product line of a materials manufacturer. We gathered ten years of engineering and manufacturing cost data and allocated these to successive platforms and products, and then generated R&amp;D performance measures. These data show the dynamic of heavy capital spending relative to product engineering as one might expect in a process intensive industries. The data also show how derivative products can be leveraged from underlying product platforms and processes for nonassembled products.

Embedded within these data are strategies for creating reusable subsystems (comprising components, materials, etc.) and common production processes. Hard data on the degree to which subsystems and processes are shared across different products frequently are typically not maintained by corporations for the duration needed to understand the dynamics of evolving product families. For this reason, we developed and applied a second method to assess the degree of reuse of subsystems and processes. This method asks engineering managers to provide subjective ratings on an ordinal scale regarding the use of technology and processes from one product to the next in a cumulative manner. We find that high levels of reuse generally indicate that a product family was developed with a platform discipline. We applied this measure of platform intensity to two product lines of integrated circuits from another large manufacturer. We used this method to gather approximately ten years of information for each product family. Upon analysis, one product family showed substantial platform discipline, emphasizing a common architecture and processes across specific products within the product line. The other product family was developed with significantly less sharing and reuse of architecture, components, and processes. We then found that the platform centric product family outperformed the latter along a number of performance dimensions over the course of the decade under examination.

Abstract: Abstract
Despite various efforts to shed light on the different aspects of repair and maintenance processes, our entire understanding of the repair practices done on consumer electronics comes from either the manufactures or professional repair experts. There is a lack of systematic, well-documented studies of repair practices by unprofessional individual consumers. Understanding the factors contributing to unprofessional repair practices is a necessity to lengthen the life span of the product and to promote repair as an eco-behavior among individual consumers. We have investigated 4210 break and fix narratives reported by consumers of electronic devices in a survey conducted by iFixit.com - a wiki-based website for repair manuals - in order to apperceive the most common failures, repair practices and challenges that individual users face in their interactive experiences with product repair. A comprehensive text mining set up has been applied to extract the most frequent product break stories and their causes of failure. Regression analyses have been employed to examine the possible links between consumer experiences of repairing electronics and their future purchase behaviors. The results of analyses indicate that in addition to the consumers' attitude toward repair, various product design features offer different levels of repair convenience, which may eventually impact the consumer's future purchase decisions.

Abstract: Abstract
The reuse of past knowledge constitutes a key factor for improving manufacturing performance, during design, planning, and operational phases. However, valuable knowledge generated and associated to products and processes on a daily basis, remains implicit and its reusability is confined to a specific machine operator or within legacy IT databases. The work proposed in this paper introduces a framework to enable reusability of manufacturing knowledge through inference rules applied on manufacturing ontologies. Initially, a mechanism is used to access a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and through a rule-based approach, it exports the analogous ontological schema. The ontology constitutes the knowledge base and is stored in a knowledge repository. An inference engine is then used to query this repository and derive additional assertions, which are entailed from the base schema, on product, process, and resource. The method is developed in a web app, which offers to the users the capability to create, activate, and share rules and results on engineering topics. The effectiveness of the framework is validated using a real industrial case from a high-precision mould-making SME.

Abstract: Abstract
The number of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) studies on foods and diets steadily increases. However, due to lack of data on food products as well as time and resource constraints, many of these studies ignore part of the system (e.g. cooking and waste in the household), which may lead to underestimating impacts greatly. This LCA study compared diets using six methods with different system boundaries; three of these are simplified methods we developed. The aim was to identify which method best optimizes data collection for life cycle inventories from cradle to human mouth of food products and diets. The principle behind the three simplified methods was that, for many foods and impact categories, the farm (or fishery) is the life cycle stage that contributes most to impacts. One average, one healthy and one vegetarian diet, each composed of up to 105 foods, were assessed. Climate change, cumulative energy demand, eutrophication, acidification and land occupation impacts were estimated. Recommendations are given on which methods, depending on study goals, offer the best trade-off among available resources (time, money, and knowledge), while providing the required robustness of results. Compared to a full LCA, simplified LCA methods can yield more accurate results at a lower cost of data collection.

Abstract: Abstract
This paper proposes a taxonomy of themes and a research agenda on sustainable infrastructure, with a focus on sustainable buildings (SB) and green infrastructure (GI). The citation databases of Web of Science formed the basis for a novel strategic thematic analysis of co-citation and co-occurrence of keywords with a longitudinal identification of themes during the last two decades (from 1995 to 2015) of an emerging and ever growing research area. SI is a multidisciplinary endeavour, including a diversified array of disciplines as general engineering, environmental ecology, construction, architecture, urban planning, and geography. This paper traces that the number of publications in SI is growing exponentially since 2003. Over 80% of total citations are concentrated in less than 10% of papers spread over a large number of journals. Most publications originate from the United States, Europe, Australia, and Asia. The main research streams in SI are green infrastructure, sustainable buildings, and assessment methods. Emerging and prevailing research themes include methodological issues of cost-effectiveness, project management and assessment tools. Substantive issues complement the research agenda of emerging themes in the areas of integration of human, economic and corporate social responsibility values in environmental sustainability, urban landscape and sustainable drainage systems, interdisciplinary research in green material, integrated policy research in urbanization, agriculture and nature conservation, and extensions of Green Building (GB) and GI to cities of developing countries.

Abstract: Abstract
The antecedents of environmental innovation and the impact of openness on technological innovation have been well studied, yet the role of external knowledge search remains largely unknown. This study explores whether six dimensions of open search (external R&amp;D, acquisition, R&amp;D cooperation, and three types of external information) enhance firms’ radical and incremental innovation with environmental effects (EI) when used either sporadically or persistently. It shows that the temporal dimension of openness matters. Persistent open knowledge search efforts are associated with a firm’s propensity to introduce EI, more so than sporadic search. Furthermore, the different types of knowledge search have heterogeneous effects on different types of EI. It also shows that persistent innovation is more relevant in the case of radical EI.

Abstract: Abstract
Nowadays, Agile Software Development (ASD) is used to cope with increasing complexity in system development. Hybrid development models, with the integration of User-Centered Design (UCD), are applied with the aim to deliver competitive products with a suitable User Experience (UX). Therefore, stakeholder and user involvement during Requirements Engineering (RE) are essential in order to establish a collaborative environment with constant feedback loops. The aim of this study is to capture the current state of the art of the literature related to Agile RE with focus on stakeholder and user involvement. In particular, we investigate what approaches exist to involve stakeholder in the process, which methodologies are commonly used to present the user perspective and how requirements management is been carried out.

We conduct a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) with an extensive quality assessment of the included studies. We identified 27 relevant papers. After analyzing them in detail, we derive deep insights to the following aspects of Agile RE: stakeholder and user involvement, data gathering, user perspective, integrated methodologies, shared understanding, artifacts, documentation and Non-Functional Requirements (NFR). Agile RE is a complex research field with cross-functional influences. This study will contribute to the software development body of knowledge by assessing the involvement of stakeholder and user in Agile RE, providing methodologies that make ASD more human-centric and giving an overview of requirements management in ASD.

Abstract: Abstract
The purpose of this work is to compare the environmental impacts of spring barley cultivation in Denmark under current (year 2010) and future (year 2050) climatic conditions. Therefore, a Life Cycle Assessment was carried out for the production of 1 kg of spring barley in Denmark, at farm gate. Both under 2010 and 2050 climatic conditions, four subscenarios were modelled, based on a combination of two soil types and two climates. Included in the assessment were seed production, soil preparation, fertilization, pesticide application, and harvest. When processes in the life cycle resulted in co-products, the resulting environmental impacts were allocated between the main product and their respective by-products using economic allocation. Impact assessment was done using the ReCiPe (H) methodology, except for toxicity impacts, which were assessed using USEtox.

The results show that the impacts for all impact categories, except human and freshwater eco-toxicity, are higher when the barley is produced under climatic circumstances representative for 2050. Comparison of the 2010 and 2050 climatic scenarios indicates that a predicted decrease in barley yields under the 2050 climatic conditions is the main driver for the increased impacts. This finding was confirmed by the sensitivity analysis. Because this study focused solely on the impacts of climate change, technological improvements and political measures to reduce impacts in the 2050 scenario are not taken into account. Options to mitigate the environmental impacts are discussed.

Abstract: Abstract
Agile development processes, such as Scrum, focus on communication, developer collaboration and delivery of working software early and continuously. User-centered systems design (UCSD) is a process emphasizing usability and the user experience throughout the system life cycle. It highlights the UCSD activities: understanding the context of use, iterative prototyping to explore the design space and active collaboration with users throughout the software development. Agile processes are by many assumed to address similar issues as UCSD, hence, by applying Agile processes the systems would become usable for the end-users and their user experience should improve. This paper discusses and interprets findings on UCSD activities in Agile projects in practice, that are analyzed according to the fundamental principles from the Agile manifesto. We show that Agile development has much to gain from integrating UCSD, and give guidance on how to integrate UCSD in Agile processes. User experience (UX) professionals need a more explicit role in the Agile projects and more authority. We recommend that they receive a “license to kill” design suggestions that are not perceived as useful by the users.

Abstract: This paper analyzes the influences of personal mastery on organizational performance, both directly and indirectly through the dynamic capabilities of organizational learning and innovation. Although these indirect interrelations are very important for improving organizational performance, they are not usually explored in research. We confirm these influences empirically in both large firms and SMEs, basing our research on a sample of 401 Spanish firms. The results reveal that in both types of firms: (1) personal mastery influences organizational performance directly and indirectly through organizational learning and innovation; (2) organizational learning influences organizational performance positively, both directly and indirectly through organizational innovation; (3) organizational innovation influences organizational performance positively.

Abstract: In the last decade there was growing interest in strategic management literature about factors that influence a company's ability to use IT. There is general consensus that knowledge and competency are necessary in developing an IT capability, but there is very little understanding of what the necessary competencies are, and how they influence IS usage in different contexts. The small and medium-sized enterprise context is particularly interesting for two reasons: it constitutes a major part of the economy and it has been relatively unsuccessful in exploiting e-business.

We explored the relationship between e-business competency and its success in European SMEs. A literature review was used to determine factors representing e-business competency, and develop hypotheses, which were tested using data collected from 339 SMEs in Europe. Our results provide evidence on the importance of certain e-business competencies on e-business success, and have implications for both research and practice in the field of SMEs.

Abstract: Models have become so fashionable that many scientists and engineers cannot imagine working without them. The predominant use of computer codes to execute model calculations has blurred the distinction between code and model. The recent controversy regarding model validation has brought into question what we mean by a ‘model’ and by ‘validation.’ It has become apparent that the usual meaning of validation may be common in engineering practice and seems useful in legal practice but it is contrary to scientific practice and brings into question our understanding of science and how it can best be applied to such problems as hazardous waste characterization, remediation, and aqueous geochemistry in general. This review summarizes arguments against using the phrase model validation and examines efforts to validate models for high-level radioactive waste management and for permitting and monitoring open-pit mines. Part of the controversy comes from a misunderstanding of ‘prediction’ and the need to distinguish logical from temporal prediction. Another problem stems from the difference in the engineering approach contrasted with the scientific approach. The reductionist influence on the way we approach environmental investigations also limits our ability to model the interconnected nature of reality. Guidelines are proposed to improve our perceptions and proper utilization of models. Use of the word ‘validation’ is strongly discouraged when discussing model reliability.

Abstract: This paper reports a case study of implementing activity-based costing (ABC) in a Portuguese telecommunications firm. It proved problematic. Production engineers were reluctant to use ABC, being skeptical about its accuracy and usefulness. Workers resisted ABC by inputting inaccurate data late. Production managers tolerated this. Production personnel had difficulty understanding ABC, relating it to their jobs, and feared it would add to work intensification and redundancies. In contrast, commercial managers, responsible for pricing and investment, and senior managers were satisfied with ABC. They believed it was more accurate than previous systems, met the requirements of regulators and financial markets, and eased consolidation of accounts. They used ABC data for decisions despite its problems.

The results were consistent with factor and process-based research on ABC implementation. For example, top management support and generous resources help explain why the project was evaluated favourably outside of production. User involvement and ownership of the project was high but the prioritisation of commercial over production needs, and education and training delays fuelled conflicts between commercial and production managers. Given inter-professional rivalries and production managers’ token commitment to implementing ABC it is questionable whether ABC could ever have been effective within production. The case confirms that evaluations of ABC implementations can vary at operating and corporate levels, and industrial relations and worker resistance are major issues. It is argued studies of ABC implementation should incorporate issues in labour process research to explain consent and resistance.

Abstract: Abstract
Programmes and policies for a Circular Economy (CE) are fast becoming key to regional and international plans for creating sustainable futures. Framed as a technologically driven and economically profitable vision of continued growth in a resource-scarce world, the CE has of late been taken up by the European Commission and global business leaders alike. However, within CE debates and documentation, little is said about the social and political implications of such transformative agendas. Whilst CE proponents claim their agenda is ‘radical’, this paper outlines its inability to address many deeply embedded challenges around issues of consumption and the consumer, echoing as it does the problematic (and arguably failed) agendas of sustainable consumption/lifestyles. Using the Sharing Economy as an example, we argue here that the ontological and sociological assumptions of the CE must be open to more ‘radical’ critique and reconsideration if this agenda is to deliver the profound transformations that its advocates claim are within our collective reach.

This study investigated the options for eco-efficiency improvement of Sinistra Ofanto irrigation scheme (Apulia region, South-East Italy). The analysis was performed by using a novel multi-criteria meso-scale approach and modeling tools developed within the EcoWater project. Ecological assessment was made on the basis of the life cycle assessment using mid-point (problem-oriented) environmental impact categories, while the economic performance was measured using the total value added to the system's final products due to water use and applied management practices. The baseline analysis indicated that the upgrading of the value chain through the adoption of innovative technologies aimed at the improvement of indicators which are related to the use of non-renewable energy sources, fresh water abstraction and fertilizer application. The innovation process was driven mainly by cropping pattern and related hydrological conditions (i.e., precipitation pattern) which directly affected water and fertilizer inputs, energy consumption and corresponding gas emissions, market price of agricultural products, production costs and the level of adoption of new technologies. The eco-efficiency improvement of irrigation scheme was observed when sub-surface irrigation, solar powered pumps and smart (remote) irrigation monitoring and modeling tools were introduced, with much more tangible benefits when technologies are jointly achieved. The uptake of innovative technologies had slight to moderate potential to reduce water and energy use and, thereby, improve the environmental performance of the system while maintaining competitive agricultural economy. However, the influence on specific processes throughout the life cycle and cause–effect relationships between stages should be analyzed carefully in order to assess the rebound effect of technologies.

Abstract: Abstract
Since the publication of the Brundtland Report, production processes and consumption patterns towards sustainability have improved. This Special Volume Section of the Journal of Cleaner Production focuses on sustainable consumption and production (SCP), and identifies further challenges and provides solutions related to resource efficiency (ReE), sustainable water systems, sustainable management, cleaner production (CP), and sustainable urban development. In order to better understand the state of the SCP issues globally, existing policy directions have been explored within this paper, as well as six newly emerged sustainability terms, which have been integrated into the existing terminology classification to better describe and understand sustainable development concepts. In this Special Volume Section, the authors have demonstrated many valuable theoretical and practical contributions to the aspects of SCP, including a number of practical examples of achieving sustainability in companies, such as using bottom-up and a top-down approaches or by implementing theoretical models. There are also examples of achieving eco-efficiency in water systems (including urban), further requiring economic incentives and governmental support, and practical experiences, providing in-situ data and evidence of impacts of measures on processes and systems regarding resource efficiency, cleaner production, and also considering life cycle assessment (LCA). The examples of SCP research and development in the fields of ReE presented in this section of the SV indicate that existing production and service processes in companies and social (urban) environment could be more sustainable, using a holistic approach to the SCP and achieving global policy recommendations.

Abstract: Abstract
Due to the improvements associated with our modern lifestyle, both personal preferences and commercial market value should be considered when undertaking the challenge of new product development. Thus, a crucial research topic is how to design a customized product for consumers. In this study, a feature recognition and shape-design process for basketball sneakers was established that integrated Kansei engineering and artificial neural networks (ANNs), in combination with famous point guards in the National Basketball Association (NBA), as the basis for constructing a topological feature map for sneakers. We used questionnaires to get 20 fans in NBA games to assign a rating value in Kansei adjectives to evaluate 50 basketball shoes and to identify the top 10 NBA point guards. The fans’ perspectives combined the psychological and physical scales for the top 10 point guards to establish a gross relationship between sneakers and the point guards. Based on competitive learning in the self-organizing map (SOM), the similarities of the inputs from the Kansei perspective concerning NBA point guards and sneakers can be reduced in their dimensions and grouped into six clusters. A back propagation network (BPN) is proposed to verify the mapping of sneakers onto point guards. The results were validated by comparing them with the target neurons based on SOM feature map. A MATLAB program was developed using SOM and BPN algorithms to verify the groups of sneakers accompanying the point guards. Then, the system can categorize the sneakers that match the players. A feature-based, shape-morphing process for the design of a new style of sneaker was implemented. A model to blend the features was constructed in SolidWorks CAD by choosing any two different shapes from the SOM map. This research was used to add the vast variety of shapes and design of sneakers from the selected SOM feature map to help designers create many different styles in a short period of time.

Abstract: The advance and pervasive applications of the Web-enabled computations are exerting a profound influence on product design and manufacturing processes, and one of the major technical shifts for product development systems is toward supporting distributed collaboration. A key component for this trend is to develop a service model that enables product development systems to be triggered and manipulated from a remote computer, so as to provide a more flexible manner to share and interoperate the executive codes and processing data. In this paper, a process planning optimization module has been wrapped as a Web-enabled service and deployed in the Internet to support distributed design and manufacturing analysis. The module consists of several optimization approaches, and a Tabu search-based approach, which can optimize the selection of machining resources, determination of set-up plans and sequencing of machining operations to achieve optimal process plans, is elaborated to illustrate the process. The Web-based service has been integrated with a distributed feature-based design system, and the latter can generate design models and re-represent them in an XML representation based on VRML and attributes of features to provide the input of the former. Through effective utilization of the Web and Java technologies, the established service and relevant system can be used by a distributed design team to organize concurrent engineering activities effectively.

Abstract: Abstract
Human beings make decisions on a daily basis according to their social environment. Social information given by such social contexts provides the basis for inferences, planning and coordination of any activity. Social machines aim to incorporate this concept of social nature and make it possible to design digital systems that make information visible to the users. This paper presents a social machine implemented as a VO where humans and machines collaborate in a creative process to transform a picture into a musical sound cloud. The VO is implemented by a MAS, and defines specialized roles for extracting sounds from the color pixels of the image. As a part of the social machine and in order to demonstrate the viability of the system, the prototype built from this model is evaluated by experts who rate the sounds produced following consonance criteria.

Abstract: Abstract
The aim of this paper is to analyze the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from floricultural production in Austria based on a small-scale case study in which emissions were calculated using highly detailed accounts of a specific nursery for the years 2009–2013. The nursery produces a large assortment of cut flowers and pot plants. In terms of methods, the study is based on a life cycle assessment approach, presenting global warming as impact indicator. To reach a meaningful comparison of cut flowers and pot plants, the functional unit “days of flowering” is developed, referring to the function of ornamental plants. This new functional unit enables to a comparison of different kind of products based on their longevity. Including this factor allows a more nuanced comparison of flowers in terms of their GHG emissions. For example, if the widespread functional unit “piece of product” is applied, cyclamen appear to be associated with high emissions, whereas their emissions are slightly below average when the functional unit “days of flowering” is used.

Abstract: Abstract
Today, the task of developing reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains in both developed and developing industries is accepted as a vital need in our societies. The growing interest in reverse issues can be clearly seen in the large number of publications, especially the ones that consider case studies in various industries. Based on its missions, Journal of Cleaner Production (JCP) is one of the most active journals in this field. Therefore, a comprehensive review is undertaken of the publications in the field of reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chains; the selection process is based on the articles accepted online in the Journal of Cleaner Production. The aim of this paper is to review, categorize, and evaluate the related papers in order to provide a systematic view of past work and an appropriate vision for future study. A total of 83 accepted online papers up to 31 December 2014 have been selected and reviewed. The selected papers are then analyzed based on their content and the appropriate developed categories. The results clarify the main trends in reverse logistics and closed-loop supply chain subjects for the Journal of Cleaner Production and the evaluations reveal some suggested opportunities for new directions of research for the journal.

Abstract: Abstract
This study took a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective to model a total of twenty forest supply chains, from seedling production to forest biomass delivery to industry. Four scenarios were analyzed, two in Sweden and two in Canada. Resource and energy consumption, and emissions to air, water and soil of conventional and biomass dedicated supply chains were evaluated and compared.

The Swedish supply chains showed a better environmental profile, on average, per oven dry tonne (ODt) than the Canadian ones in the regions studied. In terms of climate change potential the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated 48.8 kg CO2-eq, 13%, 30% and 38% lower than Swedish conventional, Canadian biomass dedicated and Canadian conventional supply chains, respectively. Sawlogs from final felling in the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated 34.2 kg CO2-eq, the lowest emissions within the roundwood assortments. Concerning the forest fuel assortments in form of wood chips, pulpwood from final felling in the Swedish conventional supply chains, and stump core and long tops from final felling in the Swedish biomass dedicated supply chains generated the lowest emissions: 48.9 kg CO2-eq, 52.3 Kg CO2-eq and 57.8 kg CO2-eq respectively. Transport from forest to industry, harvesting, extraction, chipping, and crushing were identified as hotspots in the forest supply chains. Forwarding versus skidding, chipping and transportation were the processes that differed the most between countries.

In both countries, when the supply chains were biomass dedicated the environmental impacts per ODt were lower than in the conventional supply chains. Therefore, integrating forest fuel supply with industrial wood harvesting has the potential to reduce emissions.

Abstract: PVC (polyvinyl chloride) is currently one of the most produced and used plastic materials, although its' development has been far from straightforward. This paper describes how this material, from its early commercial production on until recently, has been subject to various criticisms concerning health and environmental hazards, but despite and thanks to these criticisms became deeply entrenched in society. Hughes' systems approach proves useful to understand this history; various ways of how the PVC industry has been dealing with reverse salients are revealed. However, to understand these processes, the systems approach has to be broadened with a network-oriented perspective. Outside influences on the system have to be accounted for, as well as negotiation processes between different (sub) systems. Finally, the PVC history suggests that the dynamics of the inter-system relations might be used for de-entrenchment strategies, by addressing higher system levels or overlapping systems, or by stimulating the entrenchment of alternative (sub) systems.

Abstract: Abstract
Design for Upgradability (DfU) is one of remanufacturing strategies that extend the product lifetime through the functional enrichment of the product. Multiple Life Cycle products (MLPs) are designed with ease-of-upgrade features to allow for product upgrading to be made once the product is not functioning or becomes obsolete. To date, researches on product upgradability have generally focussed on the design features and the attributes of upgradability. However, there have been limited studies on how DfU can be applied concurrently in the product design process with the integration of modelling and optimisation process. This paper is aimed at providing insights on the significance of DfU in product sustainability. A detailed account on the works of earlier researchers that have contributed to the body of knowledge on design upgradability is also presented and discussed. A review on the modelling and optimisation methods commonly deployed in the search for corresponding design alternatives is presented and critically discussed in view of their applicability as tools to choose the best upgradable product design. The paper concludes with suggestions for further research focussing on the tools to enhance design upgradability and their significance in the development of products for multiple life cycles.

Abstract: Abstract
Foresight and design are both activities that aim to imagine the future in response to change and uncertainty. Food—a basic human need- has engaged over time in an intrinsic relationship with the design discipline. Design and Food interact at several levels: material (product), immaterial (service) but also prospective (thought).

Designers, along with other actors, shape the production, communication, packaging and distribution of food as well as the more ephemeral aspects of food consumption focused on the valorization of people’s senses and experiences. Bearing in mind that each possible design intervention strongly impacts on environmental and social behaviors, the challenge here is to address the challenge of insuring durable innovation within complex social and technological dynamics. Through the lens of an Advanced Design practice, this paper raises the importance of reconsidering the definition of trends in order to build sustainable futures for food and thus for people.

Trends are seeds of tomorrow scattered in the overwhelming detail of the present.22

Abstract: Abstract
Emergy analysis quantifies the direct and indirect contributions of nature to human systems providing a sustainability assessment framework, which couples economic growth within biophysical constraints. In this study, Puerto Rico's sustainability was assessed with emergy flow dynamics from 1960 to 2013. During this period, the island shifted from an agriculture-based economy to an industrial base of manufacture and services (1960–1970). The emergy analysis indicated an exponential decline in sustainability during this period. From 1975 to 1992, the island became more industrialized and imported more goods and services. Since 1998, although more renewable production such as forest regeneration occurred, the rapid industrialization heavily relied on imported fossil fuels, goods, and services, resulting in a system that has not been self-sufficient, nor sustainable. The latest economic crisis and the most recently passed financial rescue bill represent an opportunity to redirect Puerto Rico towards a sustainable path with policies that decrease the ratio of imported y to exported emergy, and strategies that encourage efficient use of resources and local production based on the utilization of renewable sources within this U.S. territory.

Abstract: Abstract
This contribution describes the application of an emergy-based methodology for comparing two management alternatives of biosolids produced in a wastewater treatment plant. The current management practice of using biosolids as soil fertilizers was evaluated and compared to another alternative, the recovery of energy from the biosolid gasification process. This emergy assessment and comparison approach identifies more sustainable processes which achieve economic and social benefits with a minimal environmental impact. In addition, emergy-based sustainability indicators and the GREENSCOPE methodology were used to compare the two biosolid management alternatives. According to the sustainability assessment results, the energy production from biosolid gasification is energetically profitable, economically viable, and environmentally suitable. Furthermore, it was found that the current use of biosolids as soil fertilizer does not generate any considerable environmental stress, has the potential to achieve more economic benefits, and a post-processing of biosolids prior to its use as soil fertilizer improves its sustainability performance. In conclusion, this emergy analysis provides a sustainability assessment of both alternatives of biosolid management and helps decision-makers to identify opportunities for improvement during the current process of biosolid management.

Abstract: Abstract
A circular economy has been proposed as a sustainable alternative to our current linear economic system, mainly by recirculating material resources for new product development. To understand resource recirculation in practice, this paper analyses over 50 examples of products developed from discarded materials, categorising them into the recovery routes described in the circular economy literature. The examples were obtained during interviews with waste management professionals and designers who had developed products with discards. Practical challenges to implementing a circular economy were identified based on the example categorisation and comments from the interviews. The main difference observed was that the examples mostly recirculate resources to make different types of products, whereas a circular economy requires manufacturing companies to take back their own products to secure their material resources. This is partly because in practice the material collection system in place is waste management, rather than manufacturing-centred take-back systems. A revised model for recovery routes in society in which waste management is allocated an important role in facilitating material recirculation is therefore presented. The study highlights that current product design is facing a new challenge of anticipating social, economic and environmental challenges to realise the goals of a circular economy.

Abstract: Abstract
The paper studies how producers and users benefit from reciprocal innovative activities. Ideally, such gains translate in an increased innovative dynamics of knowledge receivers, who accrue pecuniary knowledge externalities and take advantage of these external effects in their own activity. In principle, nothing prevents that, in an increasingly integrated world, knowledge externalities would be generated both in purely domestic as well as cross-country knowledge-based transactions. Nevertheless, the evidence reported in the paper suggests that localized rather than international knowledge externalities are dominating. In the empirical analysis based on a panel of 23 2-digit manufacturing and service sectors in 15 EU countries (1995–2007), dynamic panel techniques permitting to account for the possible reverse causality in the underlying relations are implemented.

Abstract: Abstract
Palestine has been encountering a serious problem represented in continuing and unfair depletion of its natural resources especially water and energy. The causes of such a problem are attributed to many sources including some Palestinian industries which adversely contribute to the shortages of these resources and consequently result in some negative environmental impacts. Among these industries are the beverages bottling and their packaging materials industries working in Palestine. This study aims at evaluating and comparing the potential environmental impacts of glass, aluminum (Al), and polyethylene terephthalate (PET) packaging materials of certain sizes of beverages using life cycle assessment (LCA) methodology based on the International Standardization Organization (ISO) standards. More specifically, the LCA study is conducted on the 300 ml glass bottles, the 330 ml Al-cans, and the 2000 ml PET bottles produced, consumed and disposed in West Bank in Palestine. Based on life cycle inventory analysis of data obtained from local sources, seven significant weighted environmental impact categories, in accordance with Impact 2002+ method, are considered in conducting the life cycle impact assessment. Such categories include water consumption, non-renewable energy, solid waste, human toxicity, terrestrial acidification, global warming potential and respiratory effects. The comparative LCA study reveals that, in the Palestinian context, the 2000 ml PET beverages bottles have the least environmental impact, while the 330 ml Al beverages cans come second after the PET bottles, whereas the 300 ml glass bottles are found to have the highest environmental impact. In addition, as revealed by the results of sensitivity analysis, the resulted environmental impacts could be significantly reduced via increasing the respective recycling rates of the three investigated packaging materials.

Abstract: Abstract
We investigate servitization by manufacturing firms that have ventured from emerging markets into advanced economies through mergers and acquisitions (M&amp;A). The study seeks to answer two questions: (a) What is the relationship between M&amp;As and servitization in the case of manufacturing firms? and (b) What are the factors influencing the configuration of servitization strategies and their implementation? The study provides a nuanced and contextualized understanding of servitization in M&amp;As. Existing research on servitization has paid insufficient attention to collaborative partnerships. There is a need to examine the role of servitization in the context of collaborative partnerships. Our empirical setting consists of Chinese manufacturing firms' acquisitions in Germany. Using qualitative research methods, we reveal a typology of servitization strategies - adding, utilizing, and reconfiguring – that underpin the combined influences of different levels of services of both acquirer and target firms in the M&amp;A. We identify integration mode and absorptive capacity as factors influencing service capability development. Our findings contribute to the literature on alternative approaches to servitization by firms from emerging markets venturing into advanced economies. We discuss the theoretical and managerial implications and suggest future research directions for servitization in collaborative partnerships in general and in M&amp;A in particular.
